/**
 * The two ways to hand somebody a feedback request.
 *
 * A request addressed to someone who is not holding a live desktop socket
 * reaches them through no channel at all — there is no transactional mail on
 * the server and team deliveries are not wired to push. The author's copied
 * link *is* the delivery mechanism, so both forms are minted here rather than
 * assembled at the surfaces that offer them:
 *
 * - `feedbackRequestConsoleUrl` works for anyone with an org membership and a
 *   browser. It is the one to paste into a chat.
 * - `buildFeedbackRequestDeepLink` is for someone who already has the app; it
 *   lands on the request's row in the organization window's Inbox, where the
 *   respond card lives.
 *
 * The console path mirrors `orgFeedbackRequestPath` in the collab repo's
 * `web-console/src/routing.ts`. The two packages cannot import each other, so a
 * change to the console's route shape has to land on both sides.
 */

/**
 * The pasteable link.
 *
 * `orgRouteKey` is the console's org route segment: its slug when the server
 * has one, and the org id otherwise. The desktop app only ever holds the id,
 * and `findTeamByRouteKey` in the console matches on either, so an id-keyed
 * link resolves for a recipient whose org later gains a slug.
