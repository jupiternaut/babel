 * Pure decisions behind the post-sign-in project walk.
 *
 * Organization membership is account-level, but the organization a project
 * window shows is resolved per workspace from that workspace's git remote
 * (`TeamService.findTeamForWorkspace`). An invited member who signs in and
 * opens an unrelated folder is a real active member whose folder matches
 * nothing, so every org surface reports "No organization". The walk gives that
 * lookup something to match; the functions here decide when to offer it, what
 * the account row should say meanwhile, and what a chosen folder may be used
 * for.
 *
 * Kept free of IPC and React so both the main process (which owns the git and
 * filesystem facts) and the renderer (which owns the dialog) can share one set
 * of rules. See nimbalyst-local/plans/simpler-org-signup-flow.md.
