/**
 * Resolves what the title bar's left-hand create button makes, per mode.
 *
 * The bar carries two create controls at opposite ends. The right end always
 * starts a session. The left end sits over the tree column and makes a thing
 * *in that tree* — so the mode picks the noun, and the visible tree selection
 * picks where it lands.
 *
 * This is deliberately a pure function with no React and no IPC: the same
 * resolution backs the button and the Cmd+N accelerator, and the only way to
 * keep those two from drifting is to have one place that decides. It lives in
 * `shared/` because Cmd+N is resolved in the main process and the button in the
 * renderer — before this, Cmd+N in Shared Docs sent `file-new-in-workspace` and
 * opened the *local* file dialog.
 */

/**
 * Mirrors the renderer's `CreateActionMode`. Declared here rather than imported so
 * the main process does not reach into renderer types; the unions are the same
 * shape, so assignment between them stays checked.
