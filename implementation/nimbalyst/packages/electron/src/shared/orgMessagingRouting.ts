 * Choose the messaging surface for an organization-scoped entry point.

 * The project mode is pinned to the active project's organization. Every
 * other target stays in the standalone window, whose org can be retargeted.
 *
 * An absent id on either side is not a match. This runs at IPC and API
 * boundaries where TypeScript is not policing the arguments, and a bare `===`
 * let `(null, null)` claim a missing target belongs to the project — the one
 * direction that leaks another org's messages into this project's mode.
