/**
 * The session-launch contract: how an agent session came to exist.
 *
 * `create_ai_session` has always carried what kind of session was made
 * (provider, worktree, workstream child) and never why or from where. Every
 * launch therefore looks identical in PostHog, which is why the largest step in
 * the activation funnel -- roughly a third of new users landing on "session
 * created, never typed" -- cannot be explained. An empty session the app opened
 * on the user's behalf and one the user deliberately opened and abandoned are
 * indistinguishable, and they mean opposite things.
 *
 * Measured over a 7-day window before this shipped: 18% of `create_ai_session`
 * events fired within 15 seconds of that person's `nimbalyst_session_start`,
 * 25% within 60. So a meaningful slice is launch-adjacent, but "adjacent to
 * launch" is a proxy, not an answer -- `initiator` is the answer.
 *
 * `initiator` is derived from `launchSource` rather than passed alongside it.
 * Two independent fields that must agree are two fields that will eventually
 * disagree, and the disagreement would be invisible in aggregate.

 * and a surface name is exactly the kind of value someone would later
 * interpolate a file or workspace name into.
