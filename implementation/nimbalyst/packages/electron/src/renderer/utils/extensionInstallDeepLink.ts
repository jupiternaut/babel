/**
 * `nimbalyst://install/<extensionId>` parsing for in-app clicks.
 *
 * The OS-level protocol handler already routes this scheme when the link
 * arrives from outside the app. This is the in-renderer half: /planning:nimbalyst-coach
 * renders install links in the transcript, and a click on one has to resolve to
 * an extension id before it can open the marketplace.
 *
 * Extracted from the App click handler so the parsing is testable on its own --
 * in particular the malformed-escape case, which throws rather than returning
 * a bad value and would otherwise surface as an uncaught error inside a
 * document-level click listener.
