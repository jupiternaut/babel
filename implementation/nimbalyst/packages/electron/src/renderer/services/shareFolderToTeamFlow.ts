/**
 * Promoting a whole local folder to the team.
 *
 * "Share to Team" was single-file by signature, so sharing a project area meant
 * right-clicking every file in it and re-picking the destination each time. This
 * is the batch shape: ask once, then publish N files into a mirrored folder tree
 * and report one summary instead of N toasts.
 *
 * Three things here are not obvious from the single-file flow next door:
 *
 * - **Only folders that hold something shareable get mirrored.** Mirroring the
 *   whole local tree would put empty folders in the team space that nobody
 *   asked for and nobody can fill from here.
 * - **Embeds are discovered once, then ordered.** A file that embeds another
 *   file in the same folder has to be shared *after* it, or the embed cascade
 *   creates a second copy of a document this batch is already publishing. The
 *   order comes from a topological sort of the in-batch embed graph; a cycle
 *   just falls back to input order and the leftover link stays local.
 * - **A promote is a one-time copy.** The shared folder does not track the local
 *   one, so a file added locally afterwards is not published. Live folder
 *   linking is its own feature and is deliberately not started here.
