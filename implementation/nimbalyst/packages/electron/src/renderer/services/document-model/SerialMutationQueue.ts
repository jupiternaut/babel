/**
 * SerialMutationQueue -- one-at-a-time execution of DocumentModel lifecycle
 * mutations (NIM-5359, defect E).
 *
 * Every file-watcher event runs its own un-awaited async handler, so two events
 * can interleave inside the model's `await`s and the older one can win. Ordering
 * therefore lives at the model boundary rather than in any one backing store:
 * mock, disk, hidden and future stores all inherit it.
 *
 * Two properties callers depend on:
 *
 * - **A rejected operation never stops the queue.** A tag lookup that fails
 *   because the history DB is momentarily busy is an ordinary transient; a plain
 *   `previous.then(next)` chain would wedge that document for the rest of the
 *   session.
 * - **An operation submitted while the queue is idle runs synchronously.** An
 *   editor reporting that its apply settled must observe the resulting drain
 *   before it returns; deferring that to a microtask would publish the next
 *   generation after the editor had already moved on.
 *
 * An operation must not submit to the queue re-entrantly and then await the
 * result -- the inner task cannot start until the outer one finishes.
