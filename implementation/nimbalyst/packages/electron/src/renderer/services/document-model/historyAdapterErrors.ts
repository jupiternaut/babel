/**
 * Typed failures for the history adapters a DocumentModel depends on.
 *
 * `DocumentModelRegistry` currently turns `getPendingTags`/`getDiffBaseline`
 * failures into empty results and `updateTagStatus` failure into success, so
 * absence and transport failure share a return value. That is what lets a
 * failed tag update look like a completed resolution: the baseline reaches disk
 * while the tag stays pending, and reopening the file finds an invisible diff
 * (NIM-5359, defect I).
 *
 * Adapters log at the boundary and then throw one of these, so initialization
 * can stay retryable and resolution can retain recovery state.
