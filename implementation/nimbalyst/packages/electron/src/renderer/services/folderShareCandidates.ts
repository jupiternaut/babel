/**
 * Which files inside a local folder can become collaborative documents.
 *
 * Kept pure and separate from the flow that publishes them because the two
 * questions have different failure modes and only one of them is cheap to test.
 * "Did we pick the right files, mirror the right subfolders, and account for
 * every file we skipped?" is arithmetic over a list of names; "did the team
 * actually receive them?" needs a live collab scope. Splitting them means the
 * arithmetic is covered without standing up a room.
 *
 * The `skipped` list is not a diagnostic afterthought. A folder promote that
 * quietly publishes 9 of 15 files reads as "shared" to the author, so the
 * summary has to be able to name the other six and why.
 */

/**
 * The most documents one folder promote will publish.
 *
 * The bound that matters is documents, not files scanned: reading 3000 names off
 * disk is nothing, while every eligible file becomes a real collaborative
 * document the whole team then sees. Past this the promote is refused rather
 * than truncated -- a half-published folder looks complete to everyone but the
 * author, and undoing it means trashing the documents one at a time. Promoting
 * subfolders separately is the way through.
