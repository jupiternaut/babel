 * A slot for one card's room, released when the card stops needing it.
 *
 * The subtle part is `acknowledgeConnectionReleased`, and it is subtle because
 * the acknowledgement is *late by construction*: the mounted child confirms its
 * provider let go only after `CollaborativeEmbedProviderCache.acquire` settles,
 * which can be after this hook has already released that lease and taken out a
 * new one for a different room. An acknowledgement that resolved "which lease?"
 * at call time would then credit the new lease and leave the old slot stuck in
 * `releasing` forever -- the 8-room ceiling would quietly lose a slot per
 * reference change, and the measurement that says this policy works (16 sockets
 * for 10 shared cards) would stop meaning anything.
 *
 * So the callback is **bound to its handle** and its identity changes with the
 * handle. `CollaborativeEmbedEditor` captures the callback at the start of the
 * acquisition it is confirming, so a late confirmation still names the lease
 * that authorized it.
