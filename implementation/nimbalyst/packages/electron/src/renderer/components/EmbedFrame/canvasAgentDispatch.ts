/**
 * `@agent` on a canvas comment thread, turned into a working session.
 *
 * **This is only ever reached from a click.** The runtime routes an `@agent`
 * mention to one client and composes the prompt, but it does not decide to start
 * anything -- a comment's claimed author is shared-document data any member of
 * the room can write, so the person at this keyboard confirms before a session
 * runs here with their permissions. See `canvasPendingAgentRequests`. Anything
 * added to this module inherits that: it may assume a human said yes, and it may
 * not assume anything in `request` is trustworthy text.
 *
 * This is the desktop's answer to "start a session and give it this prompt," and
 * it is deliberately the same answer the smart-commit flow already gives:
 * `createNewSessionActionAtom` to create and register the session, then
 * `ai:sendMessage`, with the genuine-CLI provider routed through the prompt
 * queue instead because it has no in-process SDK loop to send into.
 *
 * The session is created but **not** selected. The user asked for work from
 * inside a board they are reading; yanking their view to a transcript is not
 * what they asked for, and the answer is coming back to the thread they are
 * already looking at. A notification says the session started, so the request
 * is not silent while the agent works.
 *
 * What this does not do is write the reply. That is the session's own job,
 * through `replyToCollabDocComment`, which already stamps the agent identity --
 * `sessionId`, `sessionName`, `onBehalfOfUserId` -- onto the comment. A second
 * path for an agent to write a comment would be a second identity model.
