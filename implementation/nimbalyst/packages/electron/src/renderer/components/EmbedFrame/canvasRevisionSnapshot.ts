/**
 * Materialize one stored revision of a shared document into a detached Y.Doc.
 *
 * This is the half of pinned-revision cards that lives below React. The runtime
 * carries `revisionId` on the card's reference and refuses to let a pinned card
 * go hot; this module answers the question that makes any of that mean
 * something, which is *what content does a pinned card actually show*.
 *
 * Without it a pinned card is cosmetic. It is styled as history, locked
 * read-only, labelled "v3" -- and mounted against the live room, so it renders
 * head. Two cards pinned to two different revisions would be the same document
 * twice, with nothing on screen to say so. That is worse than not shipping the
 * feature, because the card asserts something false.
 *
 * ## Why a detached doc, and why there is still no restore
 *
 * The returned `Y.Doc` has no provider, no awareness peers, and no path back to
 * the room. It is built by the content adapter's own `restoreRevisionSnapshot`
 * into a scratch document -- the same call `previewRevisionSnapshot` makes for
 * the history dialog -- so a revision's bytes never touch the live Y.Doc.
 *
 * That is deliberate and it is the whole safety argument for Slice 5a (see the
 * header of `runtime/src/canvas/canvasRevisions.ts`, and
 * `.claude/rules/destructive-data-paths.md`). Pinning adds a card that *reads*
 * history. Nothing here writes a revision back over live content, and nothing
 * here returns a handle that could: the caller gets a document that is not
 * connected to anything, mounted into a host whose `saveContent` is a no-op.
 * Restore-over-head is a destructive path and needs the retry, verification and
 * recoverable artifact that rule requires; it is not this.
