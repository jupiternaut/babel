/**
 * What a drop onto the board is allowed to turn into.
 *
 * The interesting failures here are all silent. A drop that stores an absolute
 * path produces a card that works perfectly on the machine that made it and is
 * broken for everyone else -- and `.canvas` is a file that goes in git, so
 * "everyone else" includes the author on their other laptop. A drop that
 * accepts an arbitrary `DataTransfer` payload writes whatever a page put there
 * into a persisted reference. Neither shows up on screen.
