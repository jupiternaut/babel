/**
 * What the desktop lets you drag onto a project canvas.
 *
 * Both of the app's trees already drag something; neither was dragging it *for*
 * the canvas, so this reads what they happen to publish rather than asking them
 * to publish something new:
 *
 * - The workspace file tree writes an absolute path under
 *   `application/x-nimbalyst-file-mention` (the type the AI input reads to turn
 *   a drop into an `@` mention). A canvas reference is workspace-*relative*, so
 *   the path is rebased here -- a board that stored absolute paths would break
 *   the moment it was opened on another machine, which is the whole point of
 *   `.canvas` being a file that reviews as a diff.
 * - The shared-docs tree writes org + id + title under
 *   `application/x-nimbalyst-collab-document`. See `documentDrag.ts` for why
 *   its `text/plain` id alone is not enough.
 *
 * `accepts` is answerable from MIME types alone because that is all a
 * `dragover` gets -- see `CanvasDropSource`.
