/**
 * Promise-based "which document goes on the board?" over the registered canvas
 * picker dialog, in the shape of `requestConfirmation`.
 *
 * Imported from this module rather than the `dialogs` barrel, which drags every
 * dialog component into the caller's graph.
 *
 * Every exit resolves exactly once, including the ones that are not a choice --
 * no DialogProvider mounted, no open workspace, or the user dismissing the
 * dialog. A pending promise here does not merely lose a card: the board awaits
 * it before placing anything, so a dropped resolution wedges the "Doc" button
 * for the rest of the session with no error anywhere to explain it.
