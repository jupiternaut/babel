/**
 * The desktop implementation of the canvas's `revisions` slot.
 *
 * Two sources, joined by a pure function that lives in the runtime:
 *
 * - **The room** knows a revision exists, when it was captured, and which
 *   member captured it. That is `CollabHistoryClient.listRevisions`, the same
 *   REST client the history dialog uses, over the same document room.
 * - **This machine** knows which session produced the content, what it was
 *   asked to do, and which commit shipped it. That is
 *   `canvas:revision-provenance`, one IPC call reading `session_files`,
 *   `ai_transcript_events` and `session_commits`.
 *
 * `assembleCanvasRevisions` decides which local edit belongs to which revision.
 * That rule is the part worth getting right and it is deliberately not here --
 * it is pure, it is tested, and the web console will want the same rule the
 * moment it can answer the same questions.
 *
 * ## What this can and cannot attribute
 *
 * The local half is keyed by a **workspace file path**, so a `file` card gets
 * full provenance and a card that names only a shared document gets its author
 * and nothing else. There is no doc-id -> local-path mapping in the shared
 * document index to key on, and inventing one by title would attribute a
 * session's work to whichever local file happened to share a name. Author-only
 * provenance is the honest answer until that mapping exists; it renders as an
 * entry with a "By" line and no session, which is exactly what it means.
