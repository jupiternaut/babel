/**
 * A canvas card pinned to a past revision.
 *
 * The live sibling is `CollaborativeEmbedEditor`, and the difference between
 * them is the only difference that matters for this card: that one acquires a
 * room from the refcounted provider cache and follows head, this one loads one
 * stored revision into a detached Y.Doc and follows nothing. A pinned card that
 * went through the live path would render head under a "v3" label -- styled as
 * history, locked read-only, and wrong.
 *
 * Three consequences of "detached" that are worth stating, because each one is
 * a property the reader is relying on:
 *
 * - **No socket.** A pinned card does not take a room lease. The shared-room
 *   ceiling counts live connections, and a revision snapshot is one HTTP GET
 *   and then nothing; charging it a slot would evict a live card to hold a
 *   static one.
 * - **No write path.** The host is built with `readOnly: true` and its
 *   `saveContent` is already a no-op for collaborative documents, so there is
 *   no route from this mount back to the room. See the header of
 *   `canvasRevisionSnapshot.ts` for why that is load-bearing rather than
 *   incidental.
 * - **No peers.** Awareness is a local instance with no transport, so the
 *   editor's presence machinery works and simply sees an empty room. An
 *   extension that assumed at least one remote state would be broken by an
 *   ordinary solo document too.
 *
 * A failure renders its reason. An empty editor and "this revision could not be
 * loaded" look identical on a board, and only one of them is true.

/**

 * reached a server. `loadInitialContent` returns the empty string so the seed
