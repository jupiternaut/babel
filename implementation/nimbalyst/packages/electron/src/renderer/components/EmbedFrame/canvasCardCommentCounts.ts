/**
 * The desktop answer to "how many unresolved comments are inside this card's
 * own document?" -- the second half of the canvas's dual comment count.
 *
 * The board's own threads live in the board's comment room and the canvas
 * derives those itself. This is the *other* conversation: threads written
 * inside a card's document, in that document's room, by people who may never
 * have opened this board. The two are never added together, and this module
 * exists so the card chrome can show them side by side.
 *
 * ## Only rooms somebody else already opened
 *
 * A count is reported for a `doc` card whose room is live -- which is exactly a
 * warm or hot card, because the canvas's connection policy is what opened it.
 * Everything else answers `null`, meaning *unknown*, and the chrome renders
 * unknown as absent. Answering 0 would be a claim this module cannot support:
 * "nobody has commented on that document" is not the same statement as "I have
 * not looked." `peek` is used rather than `acquire` for the same reason -- a
 * comment badge must not open a websocket, and must not keep one alive past the
 * card that owns it.
 *
 * `file` cards answer `null` unconditionally: an unshared local file has no
 * comment room at all, and a shared one is reached through its `sharedAs`
 * binding, which the canvas already resolves to a `doc` reference before the
 * card is rendered.
 *
 * ## Why this polls
 *
 * A room opening is not an event anyone publishes. `CollaborativeEmbedEditor`
 * acquires its provider asynchronously some time after the card mounts, so
 * attaching at mount finds nothing, and there is no "room ready" signal to
 * subscribe to. Once attached, the count is fully live -- it rides the
 * document's own comment repository -- so the poll only ever discovers rooms
 * appearing and disappearing, at the cadence a user opens and closes cards. It
 * is bounded by the board's `doc` cards and stops entirely when there are none.
