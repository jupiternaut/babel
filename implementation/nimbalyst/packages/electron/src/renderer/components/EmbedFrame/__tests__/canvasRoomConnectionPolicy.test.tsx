/**
 * The shared-card room ceiling, and the one way it silently stops being a
 * ceiling.
 *
 * Room release is asynchronous by construction: a card confirms its socket is
 * gone only after `CollaborativeEmbedProviderCache.acquire` settles, which can
 * be long after the card swapped to a different document and took out a
 * different lease. A miscredited release is invisible at runtime -- nothing
 * throws, nothing renders wrong, the active count just drifts -- and the drift
 * is what makes "16 sockets for 10 shared cards" stop being true.
 *
 * The second case is the preempt-and-re-grant cycle, which is the only path
 * where a holder leaves the active set and comes back. It is the arithmetic
 * most likely to be broken by a future edit to `pump` / `preemptForHot`, and
 * equally silent when it is.
