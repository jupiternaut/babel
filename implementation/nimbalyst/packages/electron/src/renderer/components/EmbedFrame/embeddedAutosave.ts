/**
 * Autosave for an embedded editor -- inline in a document, or a card on a board.
 *
 * Lifted out of `EmbedFrame` when the Project Canvas grew a second copy of it,
 * and the second copy is why this module exists rather than a comment saying
 * "see EmbedFrame". The canvas version had a two-second timer and nothing else:
 * no in-flight guard, no bounded retry, and -- the part that actually lost data
 * -- no flush on the way out, so cooling a card inside the debounce window threw
 * the user's edit away. A third divergent copy would find its own subset of the
 * same three problems.
 *
 * The three entry points are deliberately distinct, because they want different
 * things from the backoff:
 *
 * - `tick()` is the debounce timer. It respects everything: dirty, in-flight,
 *   the retry backoff, and the blocked latch. A timer that ignored backoff would
 *   hammer a failing write every two seconds forever.
 * - `flush()` is an exit path -- the editor is going read-only, unmounting, or
 *   the board is closing. It clears the backoff first and tries now, because
 *   "wait 30 more seconds" and "this surface is about to stop existing" cannot
 *   both be honoured and only one of them can lose bytes.
 * - `retry()` is a person clicking the blocked strip. It clears the latch.
 *
 * `isFlushing()` exists for the read-only guard in `createEmbeddedFileHost`. A
 * warm card refuses writes so a misbehaving extension cannot clobber disk from
 * view mode, and that guard is correct -- but the hot-to-warm flush is not a new
 * write in view mode, it is the last write of the edit session that just ended,
 * and it has to be let through. The latch is what tells the two apart.
 *
 * No React, no atoms: callers own the timer and the dirty flag.
