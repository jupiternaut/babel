/**
 * Marks the open conversation's inbox deliveries read. Renders nothing.
 *
 * Reading a room is what marks its deliveries read. Only activating an inbox
 * row did that before, so opening #general from the sidebar left its unread
 * pill up forever, and messages arriving while it was on screen kept adding to
 * it. Each delivery is marked once — the set guards against the snapshot churn
 * a mark-read round trip itself produces.
 *
 * It is its own component because it is the window's only consumer of the whole
 * inbox snapshot: subscribing to it from the body meant every delivery, receipt
 * and presence heartbeat re-rendered the entire window, and the mark-read this
 * effect performs fed straight back into that cascade.
