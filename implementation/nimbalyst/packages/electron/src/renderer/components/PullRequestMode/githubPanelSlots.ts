/**
 * The contract between the GitHub panel's mode component and one of its lists.
 *
 * Each list (pull requests, issues) is driven by a hook that owns its own poll
 * lifecycle, filter vocabulary, selection, and actions, and hands back the
 * nodes plus chat wiring the single shared shell needs. The mode component
 * only picks which set of slots to hand to the shell — it never learns
 * anything list-specific.
