/**
 * The `github-issue` overlay: whether a panel interaction writes local state,
 * and which tracker item that write lands on.
 *
 * Three rules live here, all load-bearing, and all invisible at the call site:
 *
 * 1. **Lazy creation.** The overlay is created on the first *write*, never on
 *    the first view. Selecting an issue, opening the Local tab, or rendering a
 *    row must create nothing — an untouched issue has no local object at all,
 *    which is what keeps the tracker from filling with hundreds of triage-noise
 *    items and is what the missing status pill in the list is showing.
 *
 * 2. **Upsert by issue URL.** A write reuses the existing overlay for that URL
 *    instead of creating a second one, so the panel and `/investigate` (which
 *    upserts by `issueUrl` on entry) converge on one item rather than racing to
 *    make two.
 *
 * 3. **Adoption is terminal.** Once the overlay carries an `adoptedItemId`, no
 *    status write from the panel is planned. Escalation is the one decision the
 *    design calls one-way, and a status forwarded over it would misreport the
 *    issue as un-escalated everywhere the overlay is read.
 *
 * Only a `github-issue`-typed item is the overlay. Other types that reference
 * the same issue — an adopted `bug`, one of the legacy native bugs carrying a
 * GitHub link — are shown in the Local tab but never written to: their ladder
 * is their own, and a triage status from this panel would be meaningless in it.
 *
 * `title`, `issueNumber`, `author` and `repo` are mirrored at creation only,
 * for readability in generic tracker views. Nothing re-syncs them, because
 * holding nothing GitHub also holds is what makes drift structurally
 * impossible.
 *
 * Pure — no React, no IPC, no schema registry. useIssueOverlay.ts executes
 * what these functions decide.
