/**
 * Core editors that register into the custom-editor registry.
 *
 * Until now only `ExtensionEditorBridge` wrote to this registry, but TabEditor
 * has always had a branch for a registration with no `extensionId` (it renders
 * the component directly and falls back to a no-op extension storage), so a
 * core editor claiming a file type is the anticipated path rather than a new
 * seam. Registering here gets TabEditor's existing plumbing -- load, save,
 * dirty state, the file watcher, source mode -- for free.
 *
 * The surface is loaded lazily: `@xyflow/react` and the whole card tree have no
 * business in the renderer's initial bundle when most windows never open a
 * board. (`@xyflow/react` is pinned in the renderer's `optimizeDeps.include`
 * for exactly this reason -- a lazily *discovered* dep triggers a mid-session
 * re-optimize and a second React instance.)
