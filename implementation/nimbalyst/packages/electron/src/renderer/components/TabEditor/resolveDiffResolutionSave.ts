/**
 * The write that ends a diff review (accept all, reject all, revert, partial).
 *
 * While a diff is pending, disk does not hold what the tab last saved -- it
 * holds the agent's write, which is the diff's `newContent`. That, not the
 * tab's `lastSavedContent`, is the honest conflict baseline for these writes;
 * #3684 armed the conflict check here on exactly that reasoning.
 *
 * The ordering is the whole point of this module. The accept-all path cleared
 * the model's diff state before writing, so by the time the baseline was read
 * the `newContent` term was already gone and it silently fell back to the
 * pre-AI content -- which never matches disk, so *every* accept-all was
 * refused as a conflict and the user got the "file changed on disk" banner on
 * a change they had just accepted (#1408). Reading the baseline and clearing
 * the diff state are two halves of one operation; keeping them in separate
 * call sites is what let them drift apart.
