/**
 * Routes "scroll to this line" requests to whichever editor is mounted for a
 * file. Line links (a transcript reference like `/abs/path.md:653`, or a Quick
 * Open grep hit) usually target a file that has no tab yet, so the request
 * almost always arrives before there is an editor to service it.
 *
 * A request with no handler is therefore held as *pending* and replayed when a
 * handler registers. TabEditor registers only once its editor is mounted and
 * has content (gated on `isEditorReady`), for the same reason the DocumentModel
 * callbacks are -- an immediate-fire subscriber that runs against a null editor
 * does nothing visible and swallows the request.
 *
 * Pending requests expire. Without that, an open that fails leaves a request
 * armed against the next mount of that path, producing a scroll the user never
 * asked for.
