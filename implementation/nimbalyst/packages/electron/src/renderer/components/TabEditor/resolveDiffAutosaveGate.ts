/**
 * Whether an autosave may run while an AI edit is pending review.
 *
 * This is the decision half of `TabEditor.settleDiffBeforeAutosave`, extracted so
 * it can be exercised without an editor. The incident behind NIM-5359 is exactly
 * this decision going wrong: the mount path entered diff mode without giving the
 * model any disk truth, the gate found no diff nodes, marked the tag reviewed and
 * returned "proceed" -- and the autosave serialized the pre-edit buffer over
 * thirty minutes of agent writes as a clean, conflict-check-passing save.
 *
 * The rule that makes that impossible: **"no inline diff" is not the same as
 * "manually resolved."** Only a generation that verifiably rendered inline and
 * was then reduced to zero groups by the user may end review. Everything else --
 * a deliberate large-document fallback, a failed apply, source mode, or a model
 * that cannot say what disk holds -- blocks the write.
 *
 * `TabEditor.settleDiffBeforeAutosave` produces the inputs: `presentation` is the
 * outcome it last reported for the generation the model currently holds, and
 * `resolutionInFlight` is the model's live resolution mutex -- not its retained
 * snapshot, which survives a failed attempt and would block autosave forever.
 * The tests in `__tests__/resolveDiffAutosaveGate.test.ts` are the contract.

 * Whether Cmd+S may write while an AI edit is pending review.
 *
 * The incident this closes: manual save used to approve whatever diff nodes it
 * found (none, if an apply was mid-flight), clear the model's diff state, fire a
 * tag update it never awaited, and write the buffer. Inside the ~350ms an apply
 * spends with the buffer reset to the pre-edit baseline, that write was the
 * baseline -- and because the tab's conflict baseline had just been set from the
 * agent's content on reopen, it passed the conflict check byte for byte. That is
 * the NIM-5359 incident reachable from one keystroke.
 *
 * So the only shape that may resolve-and-save is a generation this tab
 * verifiably rendered inline and that is no longer moving. Everything else --
 * source mode, a large-document fallback with its own approval bar, a failed
 * apply, an apply in flight -- refuses and leaves the review open.
