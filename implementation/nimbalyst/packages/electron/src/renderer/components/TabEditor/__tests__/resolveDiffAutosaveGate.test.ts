 * The decision table for NIM-5359 defect A.
 *
 * The incident: a plan file sat in diff mode for thirty minutes of agent writes,
 * the gate saw zero diff nodes, marked the tag reviewed, and let an autosave
 * serialize the pre-edit buffer. Disk held the agent's content, the tab's
 * baseline held the agent's content, so the conflict check compared agent
 * against agent and passed. Every row below that expects `skip` is a shape where
 * "zero diff nodes" does not mean "the user resolved this".
