/**
 * Resolves which editor a collaborative document should open in, and -- when
 * none is available -- WHY.
 *
 * A shared document carries its type across clients, but the editor that
 * renders it is local: it comes from an extension the recipient may not have.
 * Collapsing "you don't have the extension" and "your copy is too old to
 * collaborate" into a single dead end leaves the recipient with no way forward:
 * a shared .slides.md was unopenable on a second machine because the Slides
 * extension was installed only on the first, and the tab said nothing beyond
 * the raw document type.
 *
 * Keeping this pure and separate from CollaborativeTabEditor lets the branch
 * logic be tested without mounting the collab editor tree.
