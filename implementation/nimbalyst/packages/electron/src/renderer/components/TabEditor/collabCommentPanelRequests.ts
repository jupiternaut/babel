/**
 * "Show me this comment" requests, addressed by collaborative document URI.
 *
 * Two callers raise the same request and neither can hold a reference to the
 * panel: an extension calling `comments.openPanel(...)` through the SDK, and a
 * comment notification deep link, which fires while the document is still
 * opening and the tab does not exist yet. So a request with no live surface is
 * held until one mounts, and the surface drains it on subscribe.
 *
 * Thread identity only. Nothing here carries a DOM selector, a node key, or a
 * coordinate — where the anchor *is* is answered by whichever adapter is
 * mounted at the time the request lands, never by the request itself.
