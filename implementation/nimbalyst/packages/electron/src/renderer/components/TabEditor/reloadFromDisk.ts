/**
 * The reload half of the Layer D baseline contract.
 *
 * `saveWithHistory` already funnels every save outcome through one
 * `setPersistedBaseline` helper, precisely so a new branch cannot forget to
 * move the baseline with the bytes. The reload path had no such choke point:
 * it assigned `lastSavedContentRef.current` inline, unconditionally, after a
 * `try/catch` that swallowed apply failures. That was the whole bug (#3684).
 *
 * Why an unverified baseline is destructive: the conflict check in
 * `FileHandlers.saveFile` compares `lastKnownContent` to disk. If the baseline
 * advances to the new disk bytes while the editor buffer keeps the old ones,
 * the comparison passes and the stale buffer is written as a clean save --
 * silently reverting whoever wrote the file. GitHub #647 was the empty-buffer
 * instance of this same shape (see the `safeFileWrite.ts` header, which spells
 * out "the conflict check one layer up still passed -- disk matched
 * last-known"); it was closed by refusing one *value* of wrong buffer rather
 * than the *property* of an unverified one. A stale buffer walks through the
 * same door. So does the hidden-editor case NIM-905 worked around privately
 * rather than fixing here.
 *
 * So: the baseline may only advance on a buffer we have read back and checked.
 *
 * ## Why the check is not `buffer === incoming`
 *
 * Markdown does not round-trip byte-for-byte. `$convertFromEnhancedMarkdownString`
 * followed by `$convertToEnhancedMarkdownString` normalizes bullet markers,
 * setext headings, trailing whitespace and more. An exact-equality gate would
 * therefore refuse to verify most ordinary reloads and block writes on tabs
 * that are working perfectly -- worse than the bug it fixes.
 *
 * The failure that actually loses data is narrower and is checked exactly:
 * **the buffer did not move at all** while disk did. That is the byte-identical
 * revert the incident reported. A buffer that moved but normalized differently
 * is a faithful render and is allowed through, with the baseline set to disk
 * truth -- which is what the conflict check needs and matches the behavior the
 * save path has always had.
