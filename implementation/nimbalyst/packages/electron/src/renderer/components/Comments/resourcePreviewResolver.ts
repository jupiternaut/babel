/**
 * The production `ResourcePreviewResolver`.
 *
 * Until this existed the seam had only a fixture behind it, so every resource
 * pill in the real app sat at `loading` and rendered the word "Loading"
 * forever. Tracker references were the exception only because
 * `MessageResourceReference` short-circuits them to a chip that reads the
 * tracker store directly -- they worked by bypassing this mechanism, not by
 * using it.
 *
 * THREE ANSWERS, NOT TWO
 *
 * "Not loaded yet", "you may not see this", and "here it is" are distinct, and
 * collapsing the first two is the failure this file is shaped to avoid. The
 * document index arrives asynchronously; a resolver that reported an
 * absent-because-unloaded document as `unavailable` would paint a permanent
 * "Unavailable" on a document the reader owns, because `useResourcePreviews`
 * re-resolves on the URN set and the resolver identity, not on a timer. So
 * `documents()` returns `null` for "no answer yet" and a list for "this is
 * everything you can see".
 *
 * REDACTION
 *
 * Nothing here decides what a degraded pill shows. `toPillView` is the single
 * redaction point, and the `unavailable` arm of `ResourcePreviewState` has no
 * title field to leak one through. This module's only obligation is to return
 * `unavailable` rather than a stale `available` when access is gone -- which it
 * gets for free by re-reading its sources on every call instead of caching.
