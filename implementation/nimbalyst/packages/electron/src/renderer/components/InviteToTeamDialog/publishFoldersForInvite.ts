/**
 * Publishing the folders an invitation promised.
 *
 * Reuses `shareFolderToTeam` rather than reimplementing a batch share: that
 * flow already handles embed ordering, the document cap, asset migration, and
 * the mirrored folder tree. This only decides *where* each folder lands and
 * turns N outcomes into one summary.
 *
 * Every folder goes to the team root under its own name. Asking the inviter to
 * choose a destination per folder would put a second placement decision inside
 * a dialog whose subject is a person, and the team root is the destination
 * they can most easily move things out of afterwards.
