/**
 * Whether the team the invitation goes to already has something to open.
 *
 * The invite dialog's folder picker exists for one case: a teammate accepting
 * into an empty space. Recommending a publish to someone whose team already
 * has shared content is advice they have already taken, so the dialog has to
 * know the difference before it says anything.
 *
 * The answer is deliberately three-valued. The shared-document list only fills
 * once a documents session has been started for the scope, and Settings is a
 * surface that never starts one on its own -- reading the list cold would
 * report "empty" for a team with hundreds of documents, which is the exact
 * wrong claim this hook exists to prevent. `unknown` covers everything before
 * a started session has answered, and the list atom is reactive, so documents
 * that arrive after the dialog opened still move it off that default.
