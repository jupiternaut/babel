/**
 * The decisions behind the invite dialog, kept out of the component.
 *
 * Inviting used to be one email field and a button, which is why a new
 * teammate could accept and find an empty organization: nothing in the flow
 * asked what they should be able to see, and nothing published any content for
 * them to open.
 *
 * The two halves of "what they get" are genuinely different mechanisms, and
 * conflating them is the mistake this module exists to prevent:
 *
 * - **Projects are access.** The server already grants every joiner an editor
 *   role on the org's *primary* project, so only the projects beyond it are a
 *   real choice. Grants are keyed by `teamProjectId`, which is what the
 *   server's `project_access` rows hold.
 * - **Folders are content.** There is no folder-level ACL anywhere in the
 *   system; a folder selection publishes local files into the team's shared
 *   tree so there is something to open. It grants nothing on its own.
