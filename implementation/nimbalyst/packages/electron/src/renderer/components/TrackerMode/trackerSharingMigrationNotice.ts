/**
 * What the one-time post-migration summary should say, if anything (PRD D6).
 *
 * Existing setups migrate to the single sharing axis silently. The only part a
 * user cannot otherwise account for is a tracker whose sharing state actually
 * MOVED — where this machine's old per-tracker sync setting disagreed with the
 * schema file, and the setting they were really using won. W2 records exactly
 * those as `divergences`; everything else is a rename the sidebar already
 * explains, so it is not worth a banner.
 *
 * A workspace with no legacy disagreement (every fresh install) gets nothing.
