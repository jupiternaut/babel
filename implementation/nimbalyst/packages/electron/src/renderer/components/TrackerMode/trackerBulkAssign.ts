/**
 * Placing cards in a milestone without dragging them there.
 *
 * Fifty plans exist and none of them belongs to a milestone; dragging is one card
 * at a time. This module resolves the field writes for a whole selection, and it
 * deliberately does NOT contain a relationship writer of its own -- it builds the
 * same board column a drop would land in and calls `resolveBoardColumnWrite`, so
 * the three ways to place a card cannot drift apart. Both non-drag paths -- the
 * bulk bar over a selection and the card chip over one card -- come through here,
 * so both have drag's semantics: they REASSIGN the milestone axis and preserve
 * off-axis memberships (`collection` also holds releases).
 *
 * Two items are dropped from the batch rather than written:
 *
 *  - an item whose type declares no collection field (nothing to write), and
 *  - an item already in exactly the target milestone, because re-stamping a row
 *    that is already correct is a write the user paid for and cannot see.
 *
 * Pure and React-free; the batched IPC lives in `trackerFieldSave`.
