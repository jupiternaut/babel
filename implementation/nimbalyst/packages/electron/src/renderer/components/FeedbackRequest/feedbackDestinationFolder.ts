/**
 * Turning a compose-time destination into a real folder id.
 *
 * The draft can carry three things, and all three end up here:
 *
 * - **Nothing.** The author never opened the picker, which is the common case.
 *   The request goes to a workspace-level `Feedback requests` folder rather
 *   than to `lastSharedFolderId`, because that value remembers an unrelated
 *   action -- share one spec into `Product/` and every mockup an agent asks
 *   about afterwards follows it there, which nobody chose.
 * - **A folder id.** Use it, unless the team deleted it since the picker
 *   painted, in which case fall back to the root rather than failing the send.
 * - **A pending folder.** A name the author typed that does not exist yet.
 *
 * `resolve` never creates anything. `create` is a separate call the send path
 * makes only once it is actually going to publish, so an abandoned send leaves
 * the team without an empty folder in it. That ordering is the whole reason
 * these are two functions.
 *
 * What this does NOT fix: a folder is not a hiding place. Nothing in the app
 * treats any folder as system-owned or non-browsable, and Shared Docs Home
 * lists documents straight off the index without consulting the tree at all.
 * So this tidies the tree and leaves the flat list exactly as it was. Making
 * these documents genuinely out of the way needs an origin marker on the index
 * entry, which is a schema change and deliberately not attempted here.
