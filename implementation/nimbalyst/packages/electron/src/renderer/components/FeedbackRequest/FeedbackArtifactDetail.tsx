/**
 * The desktop app's full-size artifact, for the detail popover.
 *
 * The sibling of `FeedbackOptionArtifactPreview`, and it declines in exactly
 * the same places for exactly the same reasons -- a non-`document` ref, an
 * unknown document id, a type with no registered editor. What differs is what
 * happens after it succeeds:
 *
 * - **No `ScaledPreviewFrame`.** The card scales a document down to be
 *   recognised; this one hands the editor the popover's whole box so it is
 *   read at something close to the size it was drawn at.
 * - **A priority slot.** The card's slot yields to nothing, because a preview
 *   scrolled past is not worth mounting. This is the artifact the user is
 *   looking at, so it takes a slot ahead of any card behind it -- see
 *   `useLivePreviewSlot`.
 * - **It forwards a viewport.** The scroll position lives inside the
 *   extension's iframe. The editor publishes one through
 *   `EditorHost.registerViewport` and this passes it up, which is the whole
 *   mechanism behind stepping between options without losing your place.
