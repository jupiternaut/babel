/**
 * Making a confirmed subject visible to the people being asked.
 *
 * A recipient may not have the project at all, so "send this for feedback"
 * implies "publish the subject as a team resource first". This module is the
 * only place that decides what publishing means per subject kind, and it is
 * deliberately separate from the compose host: the host owns ordering (confirm
 * -> ask -> publish -> create -> open), this owns the per-kind mechanics.
 *
 * Publishing is split into **ask** and **run**, and that split is the whole
 * design:
 *
 * - `prepareFeedbackSubjectPublish` gathers everything a subject needs in order
 *   to be published, including taking the author through the real share-to-team
 *   dialog for a local file. It changes nothing the team can see. A caller with
 *   three subjects can therefore collect three answers and, if the author
 *   abandons the third dialog, walk away having published nothing.
 * - The returned `run` is the side effect.
 *
 * Two more things a reader cannot see here:
 *
 * - **Publishing a file rewrites the subject ref.** A `file` ref is a path on
 *   the author's disk; it means nothing to a recipient. Once shared it becomes
 *   the created `document`, and that is the ref the request carries, so every
 *   recipient resolves the same object the author sees.
 * - **Publishing is idempotent.** A file already bound to a shared document
 *   returns that document instead of creating a second one, so a retry after a
 *   failed send does not litter the team's files with duplicates -- and does not
 *   ask the author to name it a second time.
