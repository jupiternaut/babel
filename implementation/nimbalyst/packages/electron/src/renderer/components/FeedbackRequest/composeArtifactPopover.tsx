/**
 * The compose surface's way to actually look at an artifact.
 *
 * A 128px card scaled down from a 1000px design is a recognition aid, and for
 * a dark mockup it is barely even that -- measured on the real thing, a badge
 * row lands 10px tall with 3.6px type on a near-black background. The preview
 * is rendering correctly and still reads as a grey box, which is exactly the
 * complaint the previews were meant to answer.
 *
 * So compose gets the same detail popover the recipient has. It lives in
 * `collab-client`, which depends on the runtime package the compose widget
 * lives in, so the widget cannot import it -- this module is the Electron side
 * of that seam.
 *
 * No vote in the footer: the author is reviewing what they are about to send,
 * not answering it. Stepping, scrolling and opening in a tab are the whole job.
