/**
 * Opening the destination picker and waiting for the author.
 *
 * Same shape as `askShareToTeam`, and for the same reason: `DialogProvider`
 * calls `onDismiss` on every removal, including the close that follows a
 * confirmation, so a caller that cannot tell the two apart would read a
 * dismissal as a choice and quietly move the author's subjects.
 *
 * Resolving null means "no answer" and must leave the draft's destination
 * exactly as it was.
