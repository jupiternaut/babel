/**
 * Wires the messaging resource-preview seam to this organization's shared
 * documents, in whichever window is asking.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS NOT JUST `useAtomValue(sharedDocumentsAtom)`
 *
 * Messaging renders in two windows. `sharedDocumentsAtom` derives from
 * `activeCollabScopeAtom`, which only `CollabMode` ever sets, and `CollabMode`
 * mounts only in the project window. Read the active list from the
 * organization window and it is permanently `[]` -- which the resolver would
 * report as "you cannot see this document" for a document the reader owns.
 *
 * So this hook addresses scopes directly instead of asking which one is
 * active: it resolves the organization's local workspaces, starts a documents
 * session for each, and reads the per-scope atom. In the project window that
 * session already exists and `start()` is memoized, so this attaches to it
 * rather than racing it. The two windows are separate renderer processes and
 * share no module state, so there is nothing to contend over between them.
 *
 * A document is addressed by id alone; the link does not say which project it
 * belongs to. Every local workspace of the organization is therefore a
 * candidate, and the union of their documents is what the reader can see.
