/**
 * The organization the active project belongs to, or `null` when it has none.
 *
 * Several surfaces need this at once — the top bar's inbox control, the account
 * popover's Messages and Organization rows — and each used to run its own
 * `findForWorkspace` round trip with its own cancel bookkeeping. The active
 * workspace atom wins over the caller's path: a window's `workspacePath` prop is
 * the root project, while the atom follows the project the user is actually
 * looking at.
 *
 * Callers must distinguish `loading` from a resolved `null`: rendering "No
 * organization" over an unfinished lookup reads as a definitive answer, and
 * during org creation it was a wrong one.
 *
 * A lookup that main could not carry out is unfinished in exactly that sense.
 * `team:find-for-workspace` reports it as `complete: false` — no auth session
 * yet, or the team directory fetch failed — and the `null` team riding along
 * with it is not an answer. Caching one as though it were is what left the
 * gutter's Organization item dead on startup: the lookup landed a beat before
 * the team directory became fetchable, nothing bumps the revision afterwards,
 * and so the stale `null` stood for the life of the window.
 *
 * "Stytch reports a session" is not the same fact as "the team directory is
 * fetchable". The auth snapshot hydrates as authenticated well before main can
 * answer, so it cannot stand in for completeness — an earlier fix that let a
 * loaded auth snapshot resolve an incomplete lookup reproduced the original bug
 * exactly. `complete` is the only signal that says main got an answer, so it is
 * the only one that resolves the lookup.
