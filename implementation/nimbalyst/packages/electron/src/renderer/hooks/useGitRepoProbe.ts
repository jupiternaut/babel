 * Resolve whether `workspacePath` is a git repository, sharing the answer
 * through `isGitRepoAtom` so every gated surface agrees.
 *
 * Every component that gates UI on the answer calls this, rather than one
 * component probing and the rest reading its write. A single writer is
 * fragile: the probe ran once per workspace mount, so any reader that came
 * up against a fresh `isGitRepoAtom` family read the default forever. In
 * dev, a Vite hot update of the module that owns the atom family rebuilds
 * it from scratch; the probe never re-ran because its dependency
 * (`workspacePath`) had not changed, and New Worktree / New Blitz / New
 * Super Loop stayed greyed out in a repository that plainly was one.
 *
 * Returns `undefined` until the IPC answers. Gate on an explicit `false`,
 * never on a falsy check, so "we have not asked yet" is not mistaken for
 * "this is not a repository".
