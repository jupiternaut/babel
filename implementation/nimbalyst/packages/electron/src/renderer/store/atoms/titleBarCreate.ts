/**
 * The title bar's left-hand create menu, published by whichever pane owns the
 * visible tree.
 *
 * The bar cannot build these lists itself: the file types come from async
 * extension contributions, the shared-document types from a catalog that gates
 * on sync readiness, and the agent variants on git availability and alpha
 * flags. Lifting all of that into `App` would mean a second copy of each gate,
 * and copies drift. So each sidebar declares its own menu here and the bar just
 * renders it.
