/**
 * Central listener for the post-sign-in project walk.
 *
 * Sign-in is the moment the dead end appears: the account gains an organization
 * while the open folder still matches nothing, so every org surface reports "No
 * organization". `stytch:auth-state-changed` is broadcast to every window and is
 * already mirrored into `stytchAuthAtom`, so this subscribes to that atom rather
 * than adding a second IPC listener for the same event (IPC_LISTENERS.md). The
 * console deep-link handoff lands in `deepLinkListeners`, which asks for a
 * refresh through `orgProjectWalkRefreshAtom`.
 *
 * See nimbalyst-local/plans/simpler-org-signup-flow.md (Item 3).
