/**
 * Installs the renderer-wide subscription for "this workspace's organization
 * changed".
 *
 * Which org a project belongs to is resolved once per workspace, so creating
 * one had to invalidate that answer explicitly. Doing it in the wizard only
 * reached the window the wizard was in; main broadcasts to every window, which
 * is where the other project windows come from.
 *
 * The payload is deliberately not read: the revision is a "re-resolve" signal,
 * and the windows that care each ask for their own workspace.
 *
 * Signing in or out changes the answer too, and `signOut()` broadcasts no
 * org-changed event — only the auth state. Without this the account popover kept
 * showing the organization row (and its Messages row) next to a "Sign in"
 * account row until the window was reloaded, and the mirror case left a
 * freshly signed-in window claiming it had no org.
