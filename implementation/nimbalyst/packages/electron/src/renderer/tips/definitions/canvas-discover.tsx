/**
 * Tip: Project Canvas Discovery
 *
 * Surfaces Project Canvas to active AI users. The pitch is the thing that
 * separates it from a whiteboard: cards mount the real editor for the file
 * they point at, so a board cannot drift from the work it describes.
 *
 * Deliberately not gated on "has never opened a .canvas": discovery tips stay
 * in the rotation rather than disappearing after a single use. Dismissal is
 * what takes a tip out.
