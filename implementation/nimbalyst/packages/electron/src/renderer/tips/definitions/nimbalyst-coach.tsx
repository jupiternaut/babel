/**
 * Tip: Nimbalyst Coach
 *
 * Surfaces the /planning:nimbalyst-coach workflow to users with real session history
 * whose workspace still shows a major surrounding feature untouched.
 *
 * The gap this closes is invisible from the inside: you cannot know which
 * feature you failed to use. Every other tip teaches one feature; this one
 * points at the command that reads the user's own project and sessions and
 * tells them which features their actual work was missing.
 *
 * Gated on trackers OR worktrees never being used so that someone already
 * exercising the whole product never sees it.
