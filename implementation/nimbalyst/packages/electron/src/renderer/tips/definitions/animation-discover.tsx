/**
 * Tip: Animation Discovery
 *
 * Surfaces the Animation editor to active AI users. Heavy tool-use sessions
 * imply the user is working on something with moving parts -- a request path,
 * a pipeline, a retry -- which is exactly what a static diagram explains worst.
 *
 * Deliberately not gated on "has never opened an .anim.json": discovery tips
 * stay in the rotation rather than disappearing after a single use. Dismissal
 * is what takes a tip out.
