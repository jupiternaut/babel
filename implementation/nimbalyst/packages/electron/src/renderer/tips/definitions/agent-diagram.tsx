/**
 * Tip: Let the agent draw the diagram
 *
 * Targets users who run heavy tool-use sessions but have never had the agent
 * drive Excalidraw via its tools. Demonstrates the per-tool usage signal
 * (`hasUsedTool`), which reads the rolled-up `mcp:<server>` key backed by the
 * tool_usage_counters table.
 *
 * This used to also require `hasBeenUsed(EXCALIDRAW_OPENED)`. Nothing has ever
 * recorded that key, so the clause was permanently false and the tip could
 * never show. `hasUsedTool` stays because the body asserts the agent has not
 * drawn one yet, which has to remain true when the card appears.
