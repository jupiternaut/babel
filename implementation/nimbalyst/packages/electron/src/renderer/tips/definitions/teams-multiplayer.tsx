/**
 * Tip: Teams Multiplayer
 *
 * Introduces Teams to active users who are not in an organization yet, on both
 * the Files empty state and the empty session transcript.
 *
 * The condition reads the org directory rather than a feature-usage key: there
 * is no local usage signal for "joined an org", and the directory is hydrated
 * at startup by stytchAuthListeners (it stays empty for signed-out users, who
 * are also part of the target audience).
