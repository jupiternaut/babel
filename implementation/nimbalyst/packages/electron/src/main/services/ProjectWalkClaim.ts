/**
 * "Which window opens the project walk" arbitration.
 *
 * `stytch:auth-state-changed` is broadcast to every project window, so every
 * window sees the same signed-out -> signed-in transition and would open the
 * same modal. The renderer used to settle that with window focus, which cannot
 * decide it: sign-in finishes in an external browser, so at the moment the
 * broadcast lands NO window is the OS-key window and every window declines. The
 * walk then sat until the user happened to focus the app again -- reported as
 * "after I left and came back, a pop up popped up", by which point they had
 * already given up looking for a way into their organization.
 *
 * Main is the one place that sees all the windows, so the claim lives here and
 * the first caller wins, exactly as `SignInAttribution` does for the funnel
 * event. This one additionally prefers the window that started the sign-in:
 * that window is where the user asked to sign in, so it is where they expect to
 * land, and it is the one worth bringing forward.
