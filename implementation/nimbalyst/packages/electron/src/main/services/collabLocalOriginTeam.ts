 * origin bindings resolve their org the same way, so without this every harness
 * `Share to Team` records nothing and raises a "No team found for this
 * workspace" error toast that outlives the step that caused it.
 *
 * Installed only by `CollabTestIdentityHandlers`, which is itself gated on
 * `!app.isPackaged` and `PLAYWRIGHT=1`. Passing null restores discovery.
