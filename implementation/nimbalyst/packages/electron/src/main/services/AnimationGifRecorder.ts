/**
 * Recording a self-playing HTML animation to an animated GIF.
 *
 * Capture lives in AnimationCapture; this file is the GIF half. The encoding
 * work -- colour conversion, palette, LZW -- is several seconds of
 * uninterruptible synchronous JS and goes to a worker thread. Run inline it
 * froze the whole app for a minute and a half on a ten-second animation.
 *
 * GIF is the wrong format for most destinations now: social platforms transcode
 * an uploaded GIF to H.264 anyway, so it pays a 256-colour quantization and
 * then gets re-encoded. It stays for the places that genuinely cannot play a
 * video. See AnimationVideoRecorder for the better path.
