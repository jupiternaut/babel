/**
 * Playing an animation in an offscreen window and taking frames off it.
 *
 * Why this runs against a real compositor rather than stamping frames somewhere
 * cheaper: the animations we export interpolate with CSS transitions and move
 * their packets with CSS animations. Nothing outside a browser knows what the
 * halfway point between two states looks like, so anything that computes frames
 * itself is reimplementing CSS and will drift from what the editor shows.
 * Capturing a page that is genuinely playing is the only version that cannot
 * disagree with the editor.
 *
 * The consequence is that capture is wall-clock bound: we record in real time
 * and take whatever frame rate the machine can sustain. That is deliberate.
 * Each frame carries the moment it was taken, so a slow machine produces a
 * choppier export of the correct duration rather than a smooth one in slow
 * motion.
 *
 * Both exporters share this. Only what happens to the frames differs.
