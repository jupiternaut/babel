/**
 * Main-process emitter for the send-wall contract.
 *
 * Ownership rule: the process that *decides* a send is refused is the process
 * that reports it. Everything downstream of `ai:sendMessage` is decided here,
 * so the renderer's catch deliberately stays silent rather than emitting a
 * generic `ipc_error` alongside this — double-counting a block would push the
 * `attempted - blocked - sent` residue negative and make it useless as the
 * "some path is uninstrumented" signal it exists to be.
 *
 * A genuine transport failure, where main never ran at all, is therefore
 * uncounted by design and shows up in that residue.
