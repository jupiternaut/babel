/**
 * "Record this sign-in exactly once" arbitration for the renderer.
 *
 * `stytch:auth-state-changed` is broadcast to every project window, so every
 * window sees the same signed-out -> signed-in transition and would record the
 * same funnel event. The renderer used to settle that with `document.hasFocus()`,
 * which is the wrong tool twice over: it is true for EVERY window while the app
 * is the active application (NIM-849, see WindowHandlers `window:is-focused`),
 * and it is false for ALL of them when sign-in completes in an external browser
 * and the app is still in the background -- so the event was duplicated in the
 * first case and lost entirely in the second.
 *
 * Main is the one place that sees all the windows, so the claim lives here and
 * the first caller wins. It is keyed (by user) and expires, so a genuinely
 * separate later sign-in is recorded again rather than being swallowed forever.
 *
 * See nimbalyst-local/plans/simpler-org-signup-flow.md.
