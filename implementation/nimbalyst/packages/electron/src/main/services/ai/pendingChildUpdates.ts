/**
 * Drop a child's still-pending `[Child Session Update]` rows from its parent's
 * prompt queue.
 *
 * Two callers, same need. The takeover path uses it because the user has gone
 * to the child directly and the parent should stop being told about it at all.
 * The notification path uses it to supersede: a child that cycles
 * idle -> running -> idle emits a fresh `session:completed` each cycle, and the
 * signature dedup in MetaAgentService only collapses duplicates *within* a
 * single child turn. Without superseding, the parent accrues one row per cycle
 * per child, all of them snapshots of the same child, and only the newest still
 * true by the time the parent reads it.
 *
 * Matching is by rendered header rather than by `document_context` provenance
 * on purpose: a JSON sub-extraction (`data->'key'`) returns a parsed object on
 * PGLite and a JSON string on SQLite, and both backends are live during the
 * migration. Plain SQL `LIKE` behaves identically on each.
