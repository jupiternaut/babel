/**
 * Resolves the provider-native workflow catalog (slash commands + skills) that
 * feeds the `/` typeahead, and the declared capabilities that say what the
 * catalog *means*.
 *
 * This replaces a per-provider fallback ladder that asked
 * `typeof provider.getSlashCommands === 'function'`, then, if the answer came
 * back empty, tried the next branch down. That shape had two failure modes and
 * both shipped: an empty catalog from a provider that genuinely has none fell
 * through to somebody else's list, and a provider that never implemented the
 * method was indistinguishable from one whose list happened to be empty
 * (#1251-#1254). Capability is now asked once, up front, and the answer decides
 * whether the catalog is read at all.
