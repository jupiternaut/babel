/**
 * The heartbeat that lets the ambient surfaces tell a working session from a
 * wedged one.
 *
 * The menu bar strip, the island panel and the iOS Live Activity all call a
 * running session "not responding" once it has been silent past
 * `STALL_AFTER_MS`. Silence was measured against the session's last lifecycle
 * transition, and a turn that spends forty minutes inside a single tool call
 * makes none -- so every long turn fell out of Running and stayed out until it
 * finished. Chunks are not a sufficient signal either, for the same reason: a
 * thirty-minute test run yields nothing between the tool call and its result.
 *
 * So the tick is driven by wall clock for as long as the turn is in flight,
 * independent of what the provider is emitting. Its cost is bounded by time
 * rather than by token rate: one in-memory event per minute per running session.

 * How long a single turn may keep claiming to be alive.
 *
 * A stop that never runs is the one way this makes things *worse* than the bug
 * it fixes: a dead session that keeps ticking is a lie no other surface will
 * ever correct, where a live session that reads as stalled at least self-heals
 * when the turn ends. The stop is in a `finally`, but a provider generator that
 * parks and never resumes reaches neither exit of that block -- the same hole
 * `gitActivityBridge.interruptOutstanding()` documents.
 *
 * This is the backstop for that case, and it is a bound on how long we are
 * willing to lie, not a judgement about how long a turn should take. Past it the
 * session degrades to the old behaviour -- stalled after the usual threshold --
 * which is the correct answer for a turn whose provider has gone away.
