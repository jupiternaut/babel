/**
 * Drain-time coalescing of agent-authored queued prompts.
 *
 * The queue drains one row per turn. That is correct for a human at the
 * composer, but it makes orchestration unbounded: every child report and every
 * [Child Session Update] costs the parent a whole turn, so a parent driving
 * five children falls further behind with each one. Messages then arrive faster
 * than they drain and the parent ends up acting on notes that later rows in the
 * same queue already corrected.
 *
 * Merging at drain time rather than at enqueue time is deliberate. At drain we
 * have the freshest set, so supersession resolves for free -- the agent reads
 * "final, frozen", "frozen again", and "correction to last note" together and
 * acts once. Enqueue-time merging cannot know what is still coming, and the
 * renderer's composer-side merge additionally races the drain.
 *
 * Precedent for the shape: ClaudeCodeProvider.drainAndFormatPendingTeammateMessages
 * and AgentMentionDispatchService's inbox-wake grouping both already collapse
 * many notifications into one turn. This applies the same idea to the queue.
