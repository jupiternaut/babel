/**
 * Re-apply an `update_session_meta` call the agent transport announced but
 * never completed.
 *
 * Measured on one install: 13 of 3856 such calls (0.34%) ended this way, and
 * they cluster — one session dropped five consecutive calls over 22 minutes and
 * never recovered, so its phase and tags stayed at whatever the last successful
 * call had set. Nimbalyst's MCP server is not the cause; a stale connection
 * answers every request with a fast 404 rather than hanging.
 *
 * Everything needed is in the arguments the agent already announced, so this
 * routes them through the same dispatcher the MCP tool would have reached —
 * deliberately not back through the transport that just dropped the call.
