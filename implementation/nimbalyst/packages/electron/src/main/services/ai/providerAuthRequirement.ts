/**
 * Single source of truth for "does the host need an API key before this
 * built-in provider can run?".
 *
 * This decision used to be copy-pasted as a `switch (provider)` into every
 * path that creates a provider. When `grok-build`, `cursor-agent`, and
 * `antigravity-gemini-agent` were added, two copies were updated and the one
 * on the send hot path (`MessageStreamingHandler`) was not — so every send on
 * those providers died with "Unknown provider" at the `default:` branch, even
 * though the factory, model registry, and settings panels all knew about them.
 * `SessionData.provider` is typed `AIProviderType | string`, which widens the
 * switch to `string` and removes any compile-time exhaustiveness check.
 *
 * Callers narrow to `AIProviderType` first and call this; the `never` check in
 * `default` makes a newly-added provider a typecheck failure here instead of a
 * runtime failure in front of the user.
 *
 * Extension-agent providers never reach this function — they defer auth to
 * their own backend module and are filtered out by `resolveExtensionAgentRef`
 * / `isExtensionAgentProvider` (see providerResolution.ts).
