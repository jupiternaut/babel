/**
 * The per-workspace queue of org feedback-request deep links waiting for a
 * renderer to be ready — a window we just created for the project, or one
 * still mounting its listeners when the link arrived.
 *
 * Consuming is destructive: whoever asks first also clears the entry. So the
 * workspace path the renderer names cannot be the only thing deciding which
 * entry it gets. A renderer that names *another* project's path would take
 * that project's queued request and delete it, and the window the link was
 * actually routed to would then find nothing queued. The caller resolves the
 * sender's own workspace from its window and hands both paths in here.
