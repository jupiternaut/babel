/**
 * ReadReceiptsStore - Database CRUD for the unread-indicator read receipts.
 *
 * Backs the `read_receipts` table (SQLite migration 0016 / PGLite worker.js).
 * Pattern follows PullRequestsStore / WorktreeStore — a factory that takes the
 * PGLite/SQLite handle and returns a typed object with CRUD methods.
 *
 * A read receipt records that a user has viewed a given entity (a tracker item
 * or a shared doc) up to a certain version at a certain time. The "unread"
 * decision itself is pure and lives in
 * `packages/runtime/src/readReceipts/readReceipts.ts`.
 *
 * Personal, not team: receipts are personal per-user state ABOUT team objects.
 * They are never written to a tracker/document row and they sync only on the
 * PERSONAL channel (see jwt-scopes.md). This store is the LOCAL persistence.
 *
 * Dual-backend caveat: BIGINT columns come back as numbers on SQLite but as
 * strings on PGLite, so every numeric read is coerced with `Number()`.
 * `last_seen_version` is nullable (trackers have no numeric version in the
 * renderer, so they watermark on `last_viewed_at` alone).
