/**
 * Clear the legacy second copy of a tracker item's identity keys out of `data`.
 *
 * `issueNumber` / `issueKey` / `typeTags` live in the `issue_number`,
 * `issue_key` and `type_tags` columns. Before the write paths were fixed they
 * were also written into the `data` JSONB, by different, non-atomic rules -- the
 * columns COALESCE, the blob is replaced wholesale from the server payload -- so
 * the two drifted. On the workspace where this was found, 245 rows carried a
 * blob key naming a different item than their own row did.
 *
 * The write paths no longer produce that copy and no converter reads it, so this
 * pass only clears what is already on disk. It is hygiene, not a correctness
 * fix: leaving the stale copy in place means every future known-set has to
 * remember to exclude it, and the one that forgets leaks a wrong key.
 *
 * ## Why this cannot cause sync churn
 *
 * The wire payload is built by `pgliteRowToPayload`, which already carves these
 * keys out of `fields`. Stripping them from `data` therefore produces a byte
 * identical payload. `sync_status`, `sync_id` and `updated` are untouched, and
 * `tracker_items` has no triggers; the generated columns project `title`,
 * `status` and `kanbanSortOrder`, none of which this removes.
 *
 * ## The guard
 *
 * A row is only rewritten when its `issue_key` and `issue_number` columns are
 * both populated -- that is what makes the blob copy provably redundant rather
 * than the last surviving record of the key.
 *
 * This matters. The `issue_number` collision branch in `TrackerPGLiteStore`
 * lands an incoming row with NULL number and key, and there is no renumber path
 * anywhere in the app to give it one back. For those rows the blob copy is the
 * only place the server's allocation still exists, so stripping it would destroy
 * the evidence needed to reconcile them. They are left exactly as they are.
