/**
 * Per-kind artwork for OS notifications.
 *
 * Platform reality, verified against Electron 43 on macOS: `icon` becomes a
 * `UNNotificationAttachment`, which the OS renders as the small preview image on
 * the *right* of the banner. The large icon on the left is always the app icon
 * and cannot be varied per notification. On Windows the same value overrides the
 * toast app-logo. So the kind is a secondary signal everywhere, never the only
 * way to tell two notifications apart -- the title still has to carry the
 * meaning.
