/**
 * The agent's working-set declaration on a Project Canvas.
 *
 * Two tools, deliberately: declare what you are editing, and release it. There
 * is no canvas-manipulation surface here and this is not the place to grow one
 * -- an agent that can move cards is a separate design conversation, and a wide
 * tool surface added by accident is very hard to take back.
 *
 * The claim is **advisory**. It renders a halo and a chip so a busy board is
 * legible; it grants the session nothing and it prevents nobody from editing
 * the same card at the same moment. Nothing downstream may read it as a lock.
 *
 * Identity is resolved here from the authenticated MCP connection's session id,
 * exactly as the collaborative-comment tools do -- the agent never names itself
 * -- while "on behalf of which human" is answered by the renderer that carries
 * the claim, because that client's awareness entry is the only place that
 * answer can be verified.
 *
 * Release also happens without being asked, twice over: the renderer drops a
 * session's claims when the session reaches a terminal state, and awareness
 * drops the whole entry (and every claim it carried) when the client goes away.
 * A session that crashes mid-edit cannot leave a card haloed.
