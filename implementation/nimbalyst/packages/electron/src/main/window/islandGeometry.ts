 *
 * Hover is decided by polling the cursor in main rather than by `mouseleave` in
 * the renderer. Entry via forwarded `mousemove` is reliable; exit is not,
 * because the window stops receiving events the moment the cursor leaves it. A
 * poll answers both with one implementation. Proven on a real machine in
 * `nimbalyst-local/spikes/menu-bar-island/`.

 * Aspect ratio below which an *internal* display is called notched.
 *
 * Electron exposes no notch API -- there is no binding for `NSScreen`'s
 * `safeAreaInsets` or `auxiliaryTopLeftArea` -- so the camera housing has to be
 * inferred from the geometry we do get.
 *
 * Menu bar height, the obvious signal, does not work. It reads 30pt on a
 * notched MacBook Pro built-in panel and *also* 30pt on a Studio Display next
 * to it: current macOS grew the ordinary bar to meet the housing rather than
 * growing the bar only where there is one. A height threshold therefore either
 * misses every notched display or claims every unnotched one.
 *
 * Aspect ratio separates them cleanly, because the notch is a strip of panel
 * *added above* an otherwise 16:10 screen. Every Mac without a housing is
 * exactly 16:10 (1.600); every Mac with one is shorter and wider-looking in
 * reverse -- 14" 3024x1964 is 1.540, 16" 3456x2234 is 1.547, 13" Air 2560x1664
 * is 1.538, 15" Air 2880x1864 is 1.545. The gap between 1.547 and 1.600 is
 * wide, and it survives scaling: macOS's scaled modes preserve the panel's
 * ratio, so this reads the same in every resolution the user can pick.

 * scaling and ~200pt at a 16"'s, and both land near this ratio. A hardcoded
 * width would be wrong on every setting except the one it was measured at.
