 * Reveal a ready-to-show window.
 *
 * A startup-cohort window always uses showInactive() so a late ready-to-show
 * cannot yank focus away from whatever the user switched to during a long load.
 * It is still shown immediately — never withheld — and the one-time
 * foregrounding at the end of startup brings the app forward.
 *
 * maximize() runs after the show it belongs to: on a hidden window Electron's
 * maximize() implicitly shows the window, which would reveal (and on macOS
 * reactivate) it ahead of the intended reveal. See PR #1079 review (ghinkle).
