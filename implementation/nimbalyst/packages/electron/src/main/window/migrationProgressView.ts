/**
 * Turns raw `MigrationProgress` into what the splash screen shows.
 *
 * Kept free of Electron so the arithmetic — which is the part that can
 * actually be wrong — is testable without a BrowserWindow.
 *
 * Two properties matter to a user staring at this for several minutes:
 *
 *   1. The bar never goes backwards. The migrator reports `percentOfTotal`
 *      per phase, so a naive pass-through resets to 0% seven times. Each
 *      phase is mapped into its own slice of the whole instead, and the
 *      result is clamped against the last value emitted.
 *   2. The ETA is either trustworthy or absent. It appears only once there
 *      is a real throughput sample, and is rounded coarsely — a precise
 *      countdown that jitters reads as broken.
 */

 * Where each phase starts and ends on the overall bar. Copying owns the bulk
 * because it is the only phase whose duration scales with database size; the
 * verification phases are near-constant regardless of row count.
