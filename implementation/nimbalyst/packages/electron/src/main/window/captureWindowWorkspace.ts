/**
 * Workspace association for the hidden screenshot capture window.
 *
 * The capture window (`?mode=capture`) is created directly by
 * `OffscreenEditorManager`, not by `WindowManager`, so it has no `WindowState`
 * and `resolveActiveWorkspacePathForWindowId` returns undefined for it. Any
 * main-process handler that resolves "the project this window is looking at"
 * therefore has nothing to work with when the sender is the capture window —
 * which is how a themed `capture_editor_screenshot` came to render every
 * extension with a backend module in an error state: the extension's renderer
 * half calls a backend tool without an explicit workspacePath (the editor-scoped
 * SDK signature does not accept one) and the call threw "No workspace path
 * available for backend tool call".
 *
 * The offscreen mount already knows the file's workspace, so it records it here
 * keyed by the capture window's `webContents.id`. Handlers resolve a sender's
 * workspace through `resolveSenderWorkspacePath`, which prefers a real window's
 * active project and falls back to the capture window's current mount.
