/**
 * The two guards that stand between an editor buffer and a user's file.
 *
 * GitHub #647: a Mac sleep/resume crash left the open file at 0 bytes,
 * recoverable only from git. Two mechanisms produced that, and either one is
 * sufficient on its own, so both are closed here:
 *
 *   1. `writeFileSync` opens the target with O_TRUNC. The file is empty from
 *      the moment the call starts until the last byte lands, so a crash in
 *      that window destroys the file. `writeFileAtomicSync` moves that window
 *      onto a temp file and publishes with `rename`, which is atomic on the
 *      same filesystem.
 *   2. Nothing refused to write empty content over a non-empty file. If the
 *      editor handed back an uninitialized (empty) buffer, the conflict check
 *      one layer up still passed -- disk matched last-known -- and the write
 *      cleanly produced 0 bytes. `shouldBlockEmptyOverwrite` refuses that for
 *      autosaves while leaving a deliberate manual save alone.
 *
 * Deliberately free of electron imports so it stays cheap to test.
