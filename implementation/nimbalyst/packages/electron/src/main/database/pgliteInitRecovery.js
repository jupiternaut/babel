/**
 * What to do when PGLite fails to initialize.
 *
 * Split out of `worker.js` so the decision is testable without standing up a
 * real PGLite. The rule this encodes is the whole point:
 *
 *   A `RuntimeError` is *any* WASM abort -- memory pressure, a bad allocation,
 *   an interrupted load. It is not proof the database on disk is damaged.
 *
 * Treating the first one as proof was destructive: the worker renamed the
 * database aside on a single stumble, and the app came back up looking healthy
 * because the project list lives in electron-store rather than in the database.
 * Established installs lost every session and all document history and did not
 * notice for hours (#1347).
 *
 * So a first abort retries the same directory, and only a repeat renames.
 *
 * Retrying narrowed that window but did not close it: two aborts in a row
 * still bought the right to move an established user's only copy of their
 * data, on nothing but a WASM error name. There is nothing we can read from
 * here that distinguishes a corrupt database from a stumble, so we stopped
 * trying to guess and drew the line at ownership instead:
 *
 *   A directory that existed before this launch is the user's. Setting it
 *   aside is their call. A directory this launch created holds nothing that
 *   can be lost, so recovering it automatically is free.
 *
 * When we refuse, the abort propagates to `index.ts`, which shows the recovery
 * dialog -- the one that lists the backups we hold and can reveal them. The
 * user gets a database that will not start and an honest account of what
 * exists, instead of a database that starts empty and looks fine.
