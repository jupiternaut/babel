/**
 * toolOutputRetentionPass -- reclaim disk by tombstoning aged tool output.
 *
 * Layer 2 driver. The rewrite itself is pure and lives in
 * `@nimbalyst/runtime` (`toolOutputRetention`); this file owns row selection,
 * batching, and lane discipline.
 *
 * ## Why this runs on the background lane
 *
 * This is not a theoretical concern. While measuring the table for the plan
 * behind this work, four consecutive read-only analytical scans of
 * `ai_agent_messages` each held the SQLite worker to its 35-second timeout and
 * hung the app badly enough to need a restart -- routine reads
 * (`document_history`, `session_files`, normally 150-250 ms) queued behind
 * them. This pass touches the same table and additionally rewrites hundreds of
 * thousands of rows, so run naively it is an outage rather than a slow
 * maintenance job.
 *
 * `WriteCoordinator.runBackground` exists for exactly this: chunks yield to
 * the event loop between units, no hot-lane write runs concurrently with a
 * chunk, and any chunk over 50 ms is reported. Every query below is bounded by
 * `id` range and `LIMIT` -- there is no unbounded scan anywhere in this file,
 * including the estimate.
 *
 * ## What is never touched
 *
 *   - `direction = 'input'`  -- every user prompt, forever
 *   - `message_kind = 'assistant'` -- every word the agent said, forever
 *   - `tool_use` calls -- name, arguments and Edit diffs, so "what did the
 *     agent do to my repo" stays answerable
 *   - `system/init` / `compact_boundary` -- session forensics
 *   - rows in a session that is currently running or waiting on the user

 * Prune lane -- delete rows that render nothing at all.
 *
 * The tombstone lane above rewrites a row's payload and keeps the row, because
 * the tool card must still render in sequence. A frame the transcript has no
 * branch for has no card to keep: tombstoning it preserves the row's fixed cost
 * (~167 bytes of index per row across four full-table indexes, plus b-tree
 * overhead) and reclaims only its content, which for these shapes is a couple
 * of hundred bytes. Deleting is what actually recovers them.
 *
 * The decision of WHAT renders nothing is not made here. It lives in
 * `@nimbalyst/runtime/storage/rawMessagePrune`, which derives it from the
 * parsers themselves -- see that module's header for why a destructive path is
 * allowed to trust it. This file only does row selection, batching and lane
 * discipline, exactly as the tombstone lane does.
 *
 * One thing row selection DOES decide, because only it can: whether a delta row
 * is really superseded. Those reasons' premise is "a later row holds this
 * content", and a turn the user cancelled -- or one whose CLI died mid-stream --
 * never wrote that row, leaving the deltas as the only surviving record of the
 * response. The classifier is pure and per-row and cannot see that; the proofs
 * below establish it from the row set, and rows they cannot prove are kept.
 *
 * Both proofs are SCOPED, and that scoping is the correction that matters. A
 * session-wide "some later `item.completed` exists" is not a proof: for
 * completed turn A, cancelled turn B, completed turn C, C's row is later than
 * B's deltas and vouches for a response nobody ever stored. Codex stamps an
 * item id on both the delta and its completion, so its proof is per item.
 * Headless deltas carry no id at all, so their proof is per turn, with turn
 * boundaries read from the session's input rows -- which this lane can never
 * delete, since it selects `direction = 'output'` only.

 * Every codex item that reached `item/completed`, with the row id that recorded
 * it, for one (session, source).
 *
 * Codex stamps `params.itemId` on a delta and `params.item.id` on the matching
 * completion, so this is an exact per-item proof and needs no turn arithmetic.
 * On the measured install all 161 surviving `item/agentMessage/delta` rows pair
 * with a completion for their own item, so the guard costs nothing real and
 * only closes the case where the turn died mid-message.
 *
 * `json_extract` over `content` sits in the SELECT list behind a `json_valid`
 * guard, never in the WHERE clause. SQLite raises on malformed JSON rather than
 * returning null, and it does not promise to evaluate `AND` terms left to
 * right, so a `WHERE json_extract(content, ...)` term could hit a row this
 * filter was meant to exclude and abort the whole pass. Select-list expressions
 * are only evaluated for rows that already passed WHERE.
 *
 * ## What the scoping costs
 *
 * Re-measured on the shape the session-wide lookup was measured against:
 * 230,000 rows, 400 sessions of 500 rows plus one pathological 20,000-row
 * session, half the rows a 4 KB payload, every session seeded with deltas so
 * both proofs run for all of them.
 *
 *   per session, memoised     old 3.2 us  ->  turn proof 140 us, item proof 102 us
 *   pathological 20k session  old 4.8 ms  ->  turn proof 4.2 ms, item proof 3.0 ms
 *   whole run, 400 sessions   old 0.6 ms  ->  90 ms
 *
 * The typical session is ~44x dearer because the old query stopped at the first
 * hit walking the session index backwards and these read the session through.
 * The pathological session is unchanged-to-cheaper: nothing could short-circuit
 * there before either. It stays per SESSION and memoised, not per row, and 90 ms
 * spread across a background pass that walks the whole table is not a cost worth
 * trading a cancelled turn's only copy for.
 *
 * The number to watch is the per-chunk one: `PRUNE_CHUNK_ROWS` delta rows in
 * 1,000 DISTINCT sessions would be ~240 ms in a single chunk, over the
 * coordinator's 50 ms warning. Deltas arrive in runs of dozens per session, so a
 * chunk realistically touches a handful; if that warning ever fires from this
 * lane, this is why.

 * `system/init` is the claude-code session header: model, cwd, tool list, MCP

 * ~10 KB blob: 24,154 rows across 4,523 sessions on the measured install, 223
 * MB, averaging 5.3 per session. Keeping the newest one per session preserves
 * the entire forensic value -- it is the most complete and most recent picture
 * of that session's environment -- and returns 170 MB.
 *
 * This is a narrower lane than the prune above and does not share its
 * classifier, because the decision is not "does this frame render" (it does
 * not, either way) but "is this copy redundant with a later one". That is a
