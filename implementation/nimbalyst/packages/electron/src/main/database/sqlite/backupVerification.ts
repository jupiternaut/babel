/**
 * Backup verification — structural check of a backup file, run off the
 * query-serving thread.
 *
 * Why this is its own module and its own worker: verification opens a
 * read-only handle to a file on disk and needs nothing from the live
 * connection, but better-sqlite3 is synchronous, so running it inside the
 * SQLite worker blocks that thread's event loop outright. It doesn't just
 * slow queries down — queued `query` messages are never dequeued. On a
 * 6.3 GB database a startup backup blocked the worker for ~66 seconds and
 * every one of the 221 requests queued behind it hit the proxy's 60s
 * request timeout.
 *
 * Two changes address that:
 *   1. `verifyBackupOffThread` runs `verifyBackupFile` in a short-lived
 *      worker thread, so the query-serving worker keeps draining its queue.
 *   2. The check itself is `PRAGMA quick_check` rather than
 *      `integrity_check`. quick_check catches malformed/out-of-order records
 *      — the damage a bad copy actually produces — while skipping the
 *      index-vs-table cross-validation that dominates integrity_check's cost.
 *      The source of these files is SQLite's own Online Backup API, so index
 *      consistency follows from the pages copying cleanly.

/**
 * Verify on a dedicated worker thread so the caller's thread stays responsive.
 *
 * `workerDir` is the directory holding the verification bundle — in practice
 * `path.dirname(__filename)` of whichever worker bundle is asking, since the
 * bundles are shipped side by side (`out/` in dev, `Resources/` when packaged).
 *
 * Falls back to inline verification when the bundle is missing or the thread
 * can't be spawned. That reintroduces the blocking, but a packaging miss must
 * degrade to today's behaviour rather than skip a data-safety gate.
