/**
 * Migration test for 0038_repair_double_quoted_review_status (#1403).
 *
 * The rows this repairs were written by a real code path against a real SQLite
 * database, so the test seeds the exact corrupted shape rather than asserting
 * on the migration's text. Exercises the real SQLiteDatabase + migrationRunner
 * path, so a missing entry in getMigrations() fails here.
