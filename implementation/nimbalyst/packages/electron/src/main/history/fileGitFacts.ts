/**
 * "Is this one file tracked, and does it differ from HEAD?" — resolved against
 * the repo that actually owns the file.
 *
 * Extracted because two callers need the same answer and only one of them had
 * it right. A project can span several folders, and a folder can be a container
 * holding several checkouts, so the repo for a file is not the workspace root
 * and cannot be derived from it. Anything that relativizes a path against
 * `workspacePath` before asking git is wrong the moment the file lives under an
 * attached folder.
 *
 * Every uncertainty answers `null`. Absence of evidence is never evidence that
 * an edit landed — callers use these facts to retire a pending review, and a
 * wrong `true` silently discards a diff the user never saw.
