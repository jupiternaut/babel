/**
 * Decide whether a pending-review tag still describes a diff worth reviewing.
 *
 * A pending tag is the baseline every red/green AI diff renders against. It is
 * stored once, keyed by absolute path, and until #1403 nothing ever checked it
 * again — so tags outlived the edits they described by months (3,284 rows on
 * one dev machine, oldest three months old), and files that git reported clean
 * still opened with a diff bar.
 *
 * `document_history` holds the ONLY copy of a pre-edit baseline; there is no
 * server-side copy. That makes this a destructive-data decision under
 * `.claude/rules/destructive-data-paths.md`, which is why it lives here as a
 * pure function over facts: the decision is testable without a git repo, a
 * database, or a live AI turn — the three environments that kept the original
 * leak invisible. Callers gather the facts; this decides; nothing here touches
 * disk or SQL.
 *
 * "Retire" means flipping `metadata.status` to `reviewed`. The row and its
 * compressed content survive — only the tag's claim on the UI is dropped.
