/**
 * The retire decision for a pending-review tag. `document_history` holds the
 * only copy of a pre-edit baseline, so every rule that drops one is pinned
 * here — including the two liveness guards, which exist because
 * `AgentToolHooks.tagFileBeforeEdit` writes a baseline equal to current disk
 * content BEFORE the tool writes the file. Without the guards, reconciliation
 * retires a live tag during that window and the user's diff never appears
 * (#1403).
