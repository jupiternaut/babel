/**
 * The menu bar strip's transient-naming state machine.
 *
 * Pure: a stream of `FleetSnapshot`s in, a `StripView` describing what to draw
 * right now out. No Electron, no timers of its own -- the caller schedules the
 * wake-ups it asks for via `holdEndsAt()`.
 *
 * The behaviour it encodes, settled in design and not to be re-litigated:
 *
 * - **Expand to name, then settle back to counts.** The strip widens to name a
 *   session at the moment that session starts wanting something, holds for a few
 *   seconds, then collapses. Permanent naming pays maximum width all day for a
 *   fact that changes twice an hour; timed rotation is motion decoupled from
 *   cause, and motion in peripheral vision pulls the eye.
 * - **A name is only news once.** After you have seen that a session is waiting,
 *   the count carries it. A session is named on the transition *into* a wanting
 *   state, not repeatedly while it sits there.
 * - **The most recently changed session owns the name.** Naming an older waiter
 *   on a newer waiter's transition would be movement decoupled from its cause.
