/**
 * What decides when the phone hears from the Mac.
 *
 * The menu bar render is free -- we own the compositor -- so the strip updates
 * as often as it likes. The phone is not: every update is an APNs round trip,
 * and ActivityKit throttles a frequent sender by silently dropping updates,
 * which looks exactly like a bug. So the desktop sends on *transitions* and
 * nothing else, coalesced.
 *
 * The three rules, and each is a separate function so it can be tested without
 * a timer:
 *
 * 1. **Nothing repeats.** A payload that says the same thing as the last one
 *    sent is dropped. `revision` and `updatedAt` change on every derivation and
 *    are deliberately excluded from the comparison -- they are bookkeeping, not
 *    news.
 * 2. **Urgency picks the debounce, not whether to send.** Something new starting
 *    to wait on you is worth a short window; a session finishing is not. Both
 *    windows exist to coalesce a burst (three sessions ending together is one
 *    update), not to rank.
 * 3. **A minimum interval is never bypassed, only queued behind.** An urgent
 *    change inside the window is sent at the end of it rather than dropped,
 *    which is what separates a coalescer from a rate limiter.
 *
 * Plus one thing that is not a transition at all: a heartbeat. A fleet that runs
 * unchanged for half an hour generates no transitions, and without a heartbeat
 * the card would cross its stale date and dim while it was still telling the
 * truth. The heartbeat is what keeps "dimmed" meaning "your Mac is gone".
