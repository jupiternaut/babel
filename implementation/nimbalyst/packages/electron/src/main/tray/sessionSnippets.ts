/**
 * A one-line "what is it actually saying" snippet per session.
 *
 * The tray cache carries state but no content, so a row can say a session is
 * running without saying anything about what it is doing. This reads the latest
 * assistant text straight out of `ai_agent_messages`.
 *
 * Two things make that cheap enough to do at all:
 *
 * - `searchable_text` is already the extracted plain text. Parsing `content`
 *   would mean decoding each provider's raw envelope in the tray, which is the
 *   job `TranscriptTransformer` exists to do exactly once. It is also empty for
 *   `tool`, `meta` and `system` rows, so filtering on it drops the noise for
 *   free -- on a real session, 555 tool rows against 83 assistant ones.
 * - One batched query for every visible session, never one per row. A per-row
 *   query here would be an N+1 against the largest table in the database.
 *
 * Snippets are fetched only while the island is expanded. Nothing about the
 * resting strip needs them, and a query per `session:streaming` tick would be
 * indefensible.

 *
 * The tray cache fills a row's title once, when the session first enters it, and
 * a session is routinely renamed after that -- by the agent's own
 * `update_session_meta`, by the naming service, by the user. The panel was
 * showing whatever the title happened to be at first sight, sometimes hours
 * stale. This is read on the same trigger as the snippets (island open only),
 * against a small table, so it costs one more round trip on a surface the user
 * is looking at.
 *
 * Separate from the snippet query rather than joined into it: that one is shaped
 * to plan off `idx_ai_agent_messages_session` over the largest table in the
 * database, and widening it to reach `ai_sessions` for a string would be paying
 * in the wrong place.
