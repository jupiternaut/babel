/**
 * Apply the Nimbalyst Dock icon (macOS).
 *
 * In dev the app runs out of `Electron.app`, so the Dock and app-switcher icon
 * is whatever this sets at runtime — without it you get the stock Electron
 * icon. That makes it fragile: macOS rebuilds the Dock tile whenever the app's
 * activation policy is set, discarding the runtime icon, so anything that calls
 * `app.setActivationPolicy` has to call this again afterwards.
 *
 * Callers: startup, and tray panel creation (see TrayPanelWindow).
