/**
 * Eviction plan for accumulated per-workstream UI state.
 *
 * `WorkspaceState.workstreamStates` holds one entry per workstream -- layout
 * mode, split ratio, sidebar visibility, open files -- keyed by session id, and
 * nothing ever removed them. One workspace had grown to 3,798 entries (2.0MB)
 * against 683 live sessions. Because the settings store rewrites the whole file
 * on every `set`, that dead weight was paid on every persist.
 *
 * The decision is kept as a pure function so the dangerous part -- choosing what
 * to delete -- is testable without a database or a real settings file. The
 * caller supplies the live session ids; this returns the plan.
