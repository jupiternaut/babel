/**
 * A short-lived cache in front of `git remote get-url origin`.
 *
 * `getRawGitRemote` spawns a git process every call and had no cache at all.
 * That is fine for one workspace and not fine for the callers that walk every
 * RECENT workspace: `getRecentWorkspaceRemoteStates` loops serially over all of
 * them (46 on the install profiled for NIM-3959), and `team:resolve-project-walk`
 * -- which drives that walk -- had been invoked 4,807 times in a single uptime.
 * Measured cost of one such walk: 909ms of main-thread time at 19.8ms a spawn,
 * matching the 2,013ms and 1,587ms `getRawGitRemote` spans in the CPU profiles
 * taken during the hangs.
 *
 * Two properties matter here:
 *
 * - **Negative results are cached.** A folder with no origin costs a full
 *   failed spawn, exactly as much as a successful one.
 * - **Lookups are single-flight per path.** The walk runs concurrently with
 *   itself, so without this a TTL cache still lets each concurrent walk spawn
 *   git for the same path before the first one resolves.
 *
 * The TTL is deliberately short rather than permanent. A remote URL is a
 * PERSISTED KEY -- every project row and personal-index hash is a SHA-256 of a
 * normalized form of it (see `gitUtils.legacyNormalizeGitRemote`) -- so serving
 * a stale remote indefinitely after `git remote set-url` would silently bind a
 * workspace to the wrong organization until the app restarted.
