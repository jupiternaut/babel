/**
 * Main-process terminal output is a BLOCKING write, and a stalled terminal can
 * freeze the whole app.
 *
 * In development the main process inherits the launching terminal, so
 * `process.stdout` / `process.stderr` are TTYs (`lsof -p <main> -d 1,2` shows
 * `/dev/ttysNNN`, not a pipe), and Node writes to a TTY synchronously on POSIX.
 * When the terminal stops draining -- flow control, a scrolled-back buffer, a
 * busy emulator -- one log line blocks the Electron main thread for as long as
 * the terminal takes to read it.
 *
 * Measured on 2026-08-27 (NIM-3959): a single `console.warn` from the slow-IPC
 * logger held the main thread for 12,638ms contiguously -- 85% of a 14.9s CPU
 * profile -- across a hang window that carried only 35KB of log output in
 * total. Volume was never the problem; the reader stalling was.
 *
 * It is also self-amplifying. The block pushes every in-flight IPC call past
 * the slow threshold, each of those logs a line, and each line blocks again.
 *
 * This guard bounds the exposure to one stalled write per cooldown. Nothing is
 * lost: the file transport is a separate electron-log transport that never goes
 * through here, so suppressed lines are still in `main.log`.
 *
 * Every terminal-bound writer shares ONE guard, because they share one TTY --
 * a stall observed on stderr means stdout is stalled too.
