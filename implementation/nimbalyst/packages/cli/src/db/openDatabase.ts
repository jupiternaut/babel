/**
 * Open a better-sqlite3 handle.
 *
 * The constructor comes from `nativeBinding.ts` rather than a static import,
 * because the bundled `nim` has no node_modules of its own and loads the copy
 * inside the Nimbalyst app instead. A static import would resolve at module
 * load, before any of that file's diagnostics could run, and fail with a bare
 * ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND. Read the header of nativeBinding.ts before changing
 * how the binding is resolved.
