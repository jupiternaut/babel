/**
 * The local client's half of CSV presence: which cell is selected, and which
 * cell this client currently has a *cell editor open on*.
 *
 * It exists because those two facts are published on one awareness state and
 * were written by two independent event paths. Selection publishes hardcoded
 * `editingCell: null` ("selecting a cell is not editing it"), which is true
 * only when no editor is open -- and RevoGrid emits focus/range events *while*
 * an editor is open. A selection event landing 56ms after `beforeeditstart`
 * therefore retracted the editing flag, and because DocumentSync coalesces
 * awareness to ~2Hz, the `editingCell` frame in between never reached the wire
 * at all: peers saw a selection box with no "editing" state and no name label,
 * permanently, because the presence heartbeat then re-affirmed it every 5s.
 *
 * So editing state gets exactly one writer -- this tracker -- and selection
 * publishes carry whatever it currently holds rather than asserting null.
 *
 * Free of Yjs and DOM, like `presence.ts`, so the ordering rules are unit
 * testable without a grid.
