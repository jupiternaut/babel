/**
 * The `.anim.json` document model.
 *
 * The animation is a named scene plus an ordered list of steps that assign
 * states to the scene's parts. Interpolation between steps is delegated to CSS
 * transitions, so the document says *what is true when*, never *how to tween*.
 *
 * Two properties are load-bearing and every change here has to preserve them:
 *
 * - **Times are integer milliseconds.** Never frame indices, never floats.
 *   Frames belong to rendering and export, not to the document.
 * - **Ids are names an agent can read and write.** `store`, `title-card`. Not
 *   generated handles. A plain `Edit` on this file has to be as legitimate an
 *   authoring path as the editor's own drag, which is what `serialize.ts`
 *   exists to guarantee.

/**
 * Freeform markup, drawn in a `foreignObject` at the given box.
 *
 * The escape hatch for everything the primitive part types cannot express:
 * real typography and type scale, flow layout, a UI mock that has to look like
 * the product rather than like a diagram of it. `node`/`shape` deliberately
 * have no font-size control, and this is the answer to that, not a workaround.
 *
 * Two constraints keep it from undermining the format:
 *
 * - **The markup is static.** Script is stripped (see `sanitizeHtml`), so a
 *   frame stays a pure function of (document, t) and the editor, the packaged
 *   HTML and the GIF capture cannot disagree.
 * - **State still comes from steps.** The part gets the usual
 *   `data-state`/`data-tone` hooks, and `--anim-tone` resolves inside the
 *   markup, so authored HTML animates through the same mechanism as everything
 *   else instead of bringing its own.
 *
 * The markup comes from one of two places:
 *
 * - `htmlFile` points at a `.html` file beside the document. This is how a set
 *   of animations shares one look: keep a `partials/` folder of the surfaces
 *   your product actually has, and reference them by name. Authoring long
 *   markup as a JSON string literal is what forced generator scripts to exist,
 *   and this is the way out.
 * - `html` is the markup inline. Still right for a few lines.
 *
 * Deliberately no bundled component library. The interesting markup is always
 * the author's own product, and a partial shipped here could only ever be
 * somebody else's app.
 *
 * `vars` substitutes `{{name}}` placeholders in whichever source won, with the
 * values HTML-escaped. That is deliberately the whole template language: enough
 * to use one partial five times with different text, not enough to grow logic
 * that would have to be re-implemented by every renderer.
