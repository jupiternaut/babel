/**
 * Where an `html` part's markup comes from, and the one substitution it gets.
 *
 * This exists because the `html` part as first shipped could only carry inline
 * markup, and inline markup in JSON has no way to say "the same widget again
 * with different text". Authors answered that with generator scripts that
 * emitted the `.anim.json`, which quietly cost the format its main property:
 * the document stopped being the thing you edit. `htmlFile` + `vars` are the
 * smallest set of features that make the document authorable again.
 *
 * There is deliberately no bundled component library. The markup worth reusing
 * is always the author's own product, so a partial shipped here could only ever
 * be somebody else's app. Reuse is a `partials/` folder in your project that
 * `htmlFile` points at.
 *
 * `vars` is deliberately not a template language. There is no conditional, no
 * loop and no expression -- only `{{name}}` replaced by an HTML-escaped string.
 * Anything more would have to be re-implemented identically by the editor, the
 * standalone export and the GIF recorder, and the first time they disagreed the
 * "a frame is a pure function of (document, t)" guarantee would be gone.
