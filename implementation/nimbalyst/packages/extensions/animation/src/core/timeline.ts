/**
 * The pure core: document plus a time resolves to what every part looks like.
 *
 * Everything downstream leans on this being a total function of
 * `(document, time)` with no hidden state and no wall clock. Scrubbing, play,
 * the selection readout, and (later) frame export all call the same resolver,
 * which is the only reason they can be trusted to agree with each other.
 *
 * States are **cumulative**: a step asserts what changes, and anything it does
 * not mention keeps whatever the previous step left. That is what makes a step
 * list readable -- you write the delta, not the whole world -- and it is why
 * resolving time `t` means folding every step up to `t` rather than reading one.
