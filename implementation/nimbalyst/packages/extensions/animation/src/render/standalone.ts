/**
 * Exporting an animation as a self-contained HTML file.
 *
 * The design constraint that shapes everything here: **the animation cannot be
 * exported as stamped frames.** Interpolation is CSS transitions and the edge
 * packets are CSS animations, so baking `data-state` into a series of snapshots
 * produces a stepped slideshow with motionless packets. The export has to stay
 * *real playback* -- a live scene with something changing its attributes on a
 * clock -- which is why the output carries a script at all.
 *
 * It does not, however, re-implement the resolver. `resolveAtStep` stays the
 * single source of truth: this module runs it once per step at build time and
 * emits the answers as data. The player shipped in the file is a dumb applier
 * with no notion of steps, cumulative state, or tone inheritance. That keeps the
 * invariant the rest of the extension relies on -- one resolver, so scrubbing,
 * playback and export can never disagree -- and it means a change to how states
 * resolve needs no change here.
 *
 * This deliberately does **not** reuse `buildStageDocument`. That function
 * produces the in-editor stage, whose contract is a script-disabled sandboxed
 * iframe; bolting a `<script>` onto it would quietly erode that. The two share
 * `buildStageCss` and `renderScene` instead, which is where the actual overlap
 * is.
