/**
 * Where the harness gets an embedding API key.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT `process.env`. Reading a provider key out of the ambient
 * environment is a hard prohibition in this repo: a user with an unrelated
 * `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in a `.env` had it silently picked up, persisted, and
 * billed for $100+. The rule is about the product, but a dev script that
 * normalises "just export the key" trains exactly the habit the rule exists to
 * prevent, and a harness that quietly spends a key nobody pointed it at is its
 * own small version of the same incident.
 *
 * The operator must name a JSON key file explicitly. Desktop credentials are
 * protected by the main-process vault and are not an offline evaluation input.
