/**
 * All of the mockup's comment wiring in one place: the pin store, the thread
 * source over the host service, and the anchor adapter registration.
 *
 * The host `comments` service is optional. When it is absent -- a mockup opened
 * outside a collaborative room, a host too old to provide it, a read-only
 * viewer with no collaboration context -- this returns a null source and the
 * editor degrades to no commenting. It deliberately does NOT fall back to a
 * local simulation: a comment that looked like it was shared and was not is
 * worse than a missing button.
 *
 * Pins still get a store in that case, because the overlay renders whatever is
 * in `mockupPins`, and a shared doc can carry pins written by a peer whose
 * host does expose the service.
