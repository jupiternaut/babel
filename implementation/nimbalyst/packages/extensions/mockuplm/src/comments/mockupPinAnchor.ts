/**
 * The mockup half of the platform's entity comment anchor.
 *
 * The shared anchor deliberately carries no geometry: `entityType`,
 * `entityId`, and a `labelSnapshot` are the whole of it, and every selector,
 * offset, and viewport stays in the extension's own `mockupPins` Y.Map. A
 * reader of the canonical `comments` array -- an agent, the inbox, a future
 * editor -- can therefore say which element a thread is about without
 * understanding anything about mockup DOM.
 *
 * Everything here is pure: an anchor, a pin snapshot, and a parsed document in;
 * a state, a label, or a scroll command out. The React layer supplies the live
 * document and owns nothing else.
