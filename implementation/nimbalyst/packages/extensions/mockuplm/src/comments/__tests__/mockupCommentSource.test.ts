 * The join between the host comment platform and the extension's pin map.
 *
 * The fake service below reproduces the two platform behaviors that actually
 * constrain this code: `createThread` refuses an anchor no registered adapter
 * reports `attached`, and deleting a thread splices it out of the snapshot
 * while resolving one only flips a flag. A fake without the anchor gate would
 * happily pass a wrong write order.
