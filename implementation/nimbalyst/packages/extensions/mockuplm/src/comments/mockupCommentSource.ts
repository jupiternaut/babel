/**
 * The seam between the mockup pin overlay and the host comment platform.
 *
 * Threads live in the canonical `comments` Y.Array, owned by the host's
 * `CollaborationCommentsService`; geometry lives in `mockupPins`, owned by this
 * extension. This module is the only place the two are joined, and it joins
 * them through the shared entity anchor alone -- no selector, offset, or
 * viewport ever reaches the platform.
 *
 * ## Ordering: pin first, thread second, roll the pin back on failure
 *
 * The order is not a preference -- the platform fixes it. `createThread`
 * refuses any anchor the registered adapter does not report `attached`, and it
 * takes the thread's quote from that adapter's `describe`. Both read
 * `mockupPins`. Writing the thread first would therefore fail with
 * ANCHOR_NOT_FOUND every time, because the pin it names would not exist yet.
 *
 * One Y.Doc transaction spanning both writes is not reachable through this
 * API. `service.createThread` is async -- it awaits a capability refresh
 * against the document access source before it writes -- so any transaction
 * opened around the call has already committed by the time the thread lands.
 * Closing that needs a synchronous or transaction-aware entry point on the
 * platform service; it is reported with this slice.
 *
 * Compensation therefore follows canonical state rather than the Promise
 * outcome. A rejected call with no thread rolls the pin back; a call that
 * persisted the thread and only then failed a notification keeps the pin and
 * is treated as committed. Pins left by a process interruption are collected
 * on a later mount by the same author after a conservative grace period.
