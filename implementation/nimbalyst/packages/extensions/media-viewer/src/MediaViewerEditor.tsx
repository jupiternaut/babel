/**
 * Plays the tab's video file.
 *
 * The element is pointed at a host asset URL rather than at bytes from
 * `loadBinaryContent`. That is the whole design: a blob built from a
 * whole-file ArrayBuffer would pull a multi-gigabyte screen recording through
 * IPC and into renderer memory before the first frame paints, where a URL lets
 * the host serve byte ranges and playback starts immediately.
 *
 * That also means seeking is only as good as the host's range support. A host
 * that answers every request with the whole file leaves `<video>` in a state
 * where seeks silently resolve back to 0 -- the failure reports itself as
 * success, so there is nothing to detect here and nothing to fall back to.
