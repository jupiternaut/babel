/**
 * CollabCodec
 *
 * Per-extension Y.Doc content contract: the single, PURE thing an editor
 * defines for collaboration. Pure functions `file bytes <-> Y.Doc shape` (no
 * React, no host imports) so the same code seeds a live editor AND runs
 * headlessly (Share-to-Team without the editor open, re-upload from local
 * origin, plain-text projection for search/AI). It lets host features
 * (re-upload, history, export, AI editing, search indexing, comments, backup,
 * restore) operate on any extension's collaborative document without knowing
 * its internal layout.
 *
 * Extensions register a codec via
 * `context.services.collab.registerContentAdapter(...)` from their
 * `activate()` function, and pass the SAME codec to
 * `useCollaborativeEditor(host, { codec, bind })`. `isEmpty` / `seedFromFile`
 * / `exportToFile` are therefore defined exactly ONCE, on the codec -- the
 * live seed and the headless seed are provably the same code.
 *
 * Codecs run only client-side (main process, renderer, extensions). The collab
 * Worker stays codec-agnostic and treats Y.Doc state as opaque ciphertext. The
 * renderer registry is authoritative; the main-process registry is an optional
 * cache (in-repo statics + text descriptors) and its absence degrades to
 * client seeding, never a hard error.
 *
 * NOTE: This is the canonical definition. The host-internal
 * `@nimbalyst/collab-adapters` registry re-imports this type --
 * do not fork the interface there.
 *
 * @see CollabContentAdapter -- the former name, kept as a deprecated alias.
