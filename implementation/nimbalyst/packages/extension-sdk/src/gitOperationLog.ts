 * (live upsert/clear). Both the Git extension's Output tab and Nimbalyst's own
 * menu-bar indicator project the same journal, so the merge and "what is running
 * right now" rules have to agree exactly -- two surfaces disagreeing about
 * whether a push is still in flight is the bug this module exists to prevent.
