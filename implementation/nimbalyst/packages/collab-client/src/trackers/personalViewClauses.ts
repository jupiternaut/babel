/**
 * Personal-lane clauses inside a team-shared saved view.
 *
 * A saved view is a team-owned object, but nothing stops someone building one on
 * top of a filter that only means something to them: `favorite` is their star
 * list and `viewed` is their own open history, and both ride the personal lane
 * behind a personal JWT. A host that has no personal lane -- the browser console
 * -- cannot answer either predicate.
 *
 * Evaluating them anyway is the trap. `getTrackerFilterValue` resolves `favorite`
 * to `false` and `viewed` to `undefined` when the context carries no personal
 * data, so `favorite = true` matches nothing and the view renders **zero rows**
 * that look like a sync failure rather than a missing capability. Silently
 * deleting the clause is the opposite failure: the view then shows more rows than
 * its author meant it to, with nothing on screen to say so.
 *
 * So: strip the clause so the rest of the view still answers, and hand the caller
 * a description of exactly what was dropped so it can be said out loud.
