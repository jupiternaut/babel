/**
 * Carrying a reader's place from one artifact to the next.
 *
 * This is the detail that makes comparing long designs actually work: expand
 * option A, scroll to the pricing table, step to option B, land on B's pricing
 * table. Without it the popover is three separate lookups and the comparison is
 * happening in memory again -- which is the failure the popover exists to fix.
 *
 * The offset carries as a **fraction of scrollable height**, never as a pixel
 * value. Two variants of a screen are rarely the same length, and 2000px down a
 * 2400px design is near the end of it while 2000px down a 9000px design is
 * barely started. Pixels would land the reader somewhere arbitrary and the
 * feature would read as broken without anyone being able to say why.
 *
 * Kept as a pure function, and tested as one, because it is exactly the kind of
 * arithmetic that regresses invisibly: nothing on screen says "you landed in
 * the wrong place", it just feels wrong.
