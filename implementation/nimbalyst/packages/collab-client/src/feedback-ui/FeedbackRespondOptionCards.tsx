/**
 * The pick-one question, rendered as preview cards.
 *
 * This is the one place the respond surface departs from the compose surface's
 * option rows, and the departure is structural rather than cosmetic. Compose
 * renders `WidgetOptionList` + `WidgetOptionRow`: a single column of horizontal
 * rows, indicator then label then description, sized to be skimmed. Here the
 * options are a grid of vertical cards -- a preview panel on top, the choice
 * beneath it -- and selection is carried by the card frame rather than by the
 * indicator alone.
 *
 * The reason is that "which of these three do you like" is a visual question. A
 * radio list answers it badly: it makes three designs look like three strings,
 * and it makes the option you can read fastest win.
 *
 * The preview panel is a seam, not a picture. The protocol's `singleSelect`
 * option carries id, label and description and nothing else, so there is no
 * artifact here to render honestly. A caller that has one -- a subject shared
 * alongside the request, a rendered thumbnail -- supplies `renderPreview`, and
 * without one the panel stays a neutral placeholder rather than inventing an
 * image the option never had.
