/**
 * What the request is *about*, wherever the request is read.
 *
 * The compose surface has shown the author their subject list since it shipped;
 * the recipient was shown nothing. That asymmetry is the whole reason this file
 * exists: a request that publishes two mockups to the team and then hands the
 * person being asked no way to reach either one is a question you cannot answer.
 * The author's own results view has the same need once the answers are in, so
 * this list is shared by both and is named for the subjects, not the surface.
 *
 * Two things here are deliberate:
 *
 * - **The label comes from the request, never from the ref.** By the time a
 *   subject reaches a recipient, publishing has rewritten a `file` ref to the
 *   created `document`, so `sourceId` is an opaque id. `FeedbackArtifact` exists
 *   to carry the author's words alongside it, on the same reasoning as
 *   `BoundedPreview`.
 * - **No host means readable, not hidden.** Without `onOpen` the rows render as
 *   plain text rather than disappearing. A recipient who cannot open a subject
 *   should still know what they are being asked about, and the surrounding card
 *   already takes this stance for submitting.
