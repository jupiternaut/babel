/**
 * Studying one option properly without leaving the comparison.
 *
 * The level that was missing. Before this, deciding between designs had two
 * stops and neither decided anything: a 128px card, which tells options apart
 * but cannot show a layout, and a full tab, which shows one design properly and
 * costs you the others. Opening a tab is what loses the comparison -- by the
 * time you are back, you are comparing against memory.
 *
 * So the popover is near-viewport, it is anchored to the card it grew from, and
 * two things live inside it that would otherwise be somewhere else:
 *
 * - **The vote is in the footer.** Same rule as the comparison itself: if
 *   deciding means dismissing first, the surface has split the decision from
 *   the thing it is about all over again.
 * - **Stepping carries your place.** Scroll to the pricing table in A, step to
 *   B, land on B's pricing table. As a fraction, never as pixels -- see
 *   `artifactScrollCarry`.
 *
 * ## The content is live, and that has a cost worth naming
 *
 * Clicks reach the mockup: hover states, disclosure toggles, tab strips inside
 * the design. That is most of what makes a design feel like a thing rather than
 * a picture of one.
 *
 * The cost is that a dead-end control now reads as a bug. Nothing was clickable
 * before and nobody expected anything; now an unbuilt button inside someone's
 * mockup looks broken and gets filed as one. The chrome answers that: it is
 * persistent, quiet, and says what this is -- a mockup, by name -- rather than
 * presenting an unlabelled interactive surface.
 *
 * Interactive is not editable, and the boundary is structural rather than
 * enforced: `MockupEditor` holds the HTML *source* in a `Y.Text` and renders it
 * into the iframe, so DOM mutation inside the frame has no path back to the
 * shared document. That safety is a property of how the editor is built today
 * and nobody wrote it down, so it is covered by a test rather than trusted.
