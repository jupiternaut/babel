/**
 * The carry is the difference between "compare three designs" and "look up
 * three designs one at a time", and it fails silently: land in the wrong place
 * and the popover still renders a document, just not the part you were reading.
 * Nothing throws and nothing looks broken, which is why the arithmetic is a
 * pure function with a test rather than three lines inside a component.
