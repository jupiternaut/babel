/**
 * Match-and-rank for a quick-open palette over a mixed corpus.
 *
 * The corpus is documents and tracker items together, which is the whole
 * difficulty: they have nothing in common except a title and a timestamp, and
 * ranking them against each other by "whatever each surface already sorts by"
 * gives an order that changes meaning depending on which kind happens to be
 * loaded. So both are projected onto one `QuickOpenEntry` and scored by *where*
 * the query matched, not by which kind matched.
 *
 * Pure and host-free on purpose. Nothing about the ranking is visible on
 * screen -- a reader cannot tell a correct order from a plausible one -- so
 * this is the part that has to be tested rather than looked at.
