 * desktop tag board and item detail as well. Their private copies had already
 * drifted: `critical` was `#dc2626` in the detail pane and `#ef4444`
 * everywhere else, so the same item read as two different priorities depending
 * on which surface you opened it from. New swatches belong here, not beside
 * the component that needed one.
