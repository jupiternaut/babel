/**
 * The one subscription every tracker surface reads from.
 *
 * `TrackerDataSource` is a projection/command seam, not a store: it hands out a
 * snapshot and then a stream of changes. Turning that into React state exactly
 * once -- here -- is what keeps the grid, the board, the list, and the detail
 * panel from disagreeing about what the room contains, and what keeps a host
 * from needing four subscriptions to render one screen.
 *
 * The state is deliberately record-shaped rather than item-shaped. Every shared
 * selector (`filterTrackerItems`, `buildTrackerBoardColumns`, `buildGridSource`)
 * speaks `TrackerRecord`, so the conversion happens at the boundary and nowhere
 * else.

 * return the same reference for that snapshot or React treats it as a change
 * loop. Consumers should still select the narrowest stable field they need.
