/**
 * The tinted pill that names a type, a tag, or a priority.
 *
 * The board card alone carried three hand-rolled copies of the same
 * `color` + `${color}20` background arithmetic, at three slightly different font
 * sizes for no reason anyone recorded. Two sizes are enough: the value's own
 * badge, and the secondary tags that sit beside it.
 *
 * The hue is handed to CSS as `--tracker-swatch` and every derived color is
 * resolved from it against the canonical theme variables -- see
 * `trackerSwatch.css` for why that is not done here in JS.
