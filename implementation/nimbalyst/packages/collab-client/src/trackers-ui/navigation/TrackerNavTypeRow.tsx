/**
 * One row of the tracker navigation tree: type icon, name, trailing count.
 *
 * Desktop's `TrackerSidebar` and the browser console's pane are two hosts over
 * the same server-owned tree, and each had grown its own copy of this row. They
 * had already drifted: the console's copy lost the per-type icon color, which
 * is the one thing that lets a reader find a tracker in a ~25-row list without
 * reading every label, and the two disagreed on horizontal padding so a nested
 * row sat at a different indent in each.
 *
 * What actually differs between the hosts is behaviour, not appearance --
 * desktop drags rows to reorder the tree, the console only navigates it -- so
 * the difference arrives as DOM props on the button rather than as a second
 * component. Nothing here decides what a row does; `onClick`, `draggable`,
 * `data-testid` and the drag handlers all come from the host.
 *
 * The "All" row goes through here too, with a synthetic model. It is the same
 * row shape and it used to be a third hand-written copy in each host.
