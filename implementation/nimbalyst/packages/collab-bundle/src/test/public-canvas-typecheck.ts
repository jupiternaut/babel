/**
 * `types/canvas.d.ts` is hand-authored (see its header), so nothing but a
 * compile-time assertion stops it drifting from the runtime canvas module it
 * describes.
 *
 * The codec assertion is deliberately one-directional. The published codec type
 * is a documented *narrowing* of the SDK's `CollabCodec` -- it omits the
 * optional structured/comment-anchor/revision members -- so only "the real
 * codec satisfies the published type" is a true statement. The per-member
 * assignments below are what actually catch drift: they compare the four
 * signatures a browser host calls, in both directions, so a changed parameter
 * or return type fails here rather than at the console's mount.
