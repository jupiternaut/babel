/**
 * Browser resolver for `collab-asset://` document attachments.
 *
 * The desktop app registers `collab-asset://` as a real Chromium protocol and
 * serves it from the main process. A browser cannot do that, so the bundle
 * resolves the URI itself: fetch the asset over the same HTTPS API the desktop
 * protocol handler uses, and hand the editor a `blob:` URL it can put in
 * `<img src>`. Without this every image in a shared document renders as the
 * broken-asset placeholder in the web console.
 *
 * Two details this cannot get wrong:
 *
 * - The response body is served as `application/octet-stream`; the real type
 *   is in `X-Collab-Asset-Mime-Type`. A blob built from the response's own
 *   Content-Type will not render as an image.
 * - `<img src>` cannot carry an Authorization header, which is why the bytes
 *   are fetched here (with the team JWT) rather than pointed at directly.
