/**
 * What a browser host can and cannot do for an extension editor.
 *
 * This table is the source of truth for the classification, not a doc: the
 * host in `browserExtensionHost.ts` builds every one of its members from it,
 * and `EditorHost.capabilities` hands the same table to the extension so it
 * can branch before it calls.
 *
 * Two rules drove every row.
 *
 * 1. **A capability the host cannot provide must be detectable.** Where the
 *    SDK member is optional the host simply omits it, which extensions already
 *    understand. Where the member is required by `EditorHost` and cannot be
 *    omitted, the host still answers `false` here.
 * 2. **A required member that cannot work must fail, not resolve.** The one
 *    that matters is `saveContent`: resolving it would tell an editor its
 *    document had been written to a file that does not exist, and the editor
 *    would clear its dirty state on the strength of it. It rejects with
 *    {@link BrowserEditorCapabilityError} instead.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * **THIS TABLE IS AN API CONTRACT, NOT A SECURITY BOUNDARY.**
 *
 * Read that before adding anything here that sounds like a permission. An
 * extension bundle is imported into the embedding page's own realm: it shares
 * one `window`, one module graph and one origin with the console. Nothing in
 * this file can stop bundle code from calling `fetch`, reading `localStorage`,
 * or reaching the team JWT through a closure it can see. `supports()` answering
 * `false` means "the host will not do this for you"; it has never meant "you
 * cannot do this".
 *
 * That is acceptable today for exactly one reason, and it is not a property of
 * this code: the console loads a single first-party bundle, pinned at build
 * time from a workspace package, with the production build refusing dirty
 * `file:` inputs and recording source provenance. The bundle is as trusted as
 * the console itself because it *is* shipped by the console's own build.
 *
 * So: **before the browser host loads a bundle it did not build -- a
 * marketplace fetch, a user-supplied URL, a third-party publisher -- it needs a
 * real isolation boundary first** (an iframe or Worker, with the Y.Doc and this
 * host reached over `postMessage`). Widening `EditorHostCapability` or the
 * permission block below is not a substitute and will not get you one. See the
 * "Browser codec hosts" section of `docs/EXTENSION_ARCHITECTURE.md`.

/**
 * How a browser host answers `permissions: { filesystem: true }`.
 *
 * **Declared-but-ungranted.** The manifest field stays valid and loading is
 * never refused over it; the host simply grants no filesystem capability
 * (`host.fs` absent, `saveContent` rejecting, `projectFileSystem` and
 * `localFileSave` in the gap list).
 *
 * The alternative -- refusing to load an extension that declares it -- was
 * rejected because the permission is declared for the extension's *services*
 * (`context.services.filesystem`, AI tools reading workspace files), not for
 * its editor contribution, and every editor extension that ships today
 * declares it. Refusing on the declaration alone would exclude all of them
 * from the browser to protect against a call the collaborative editor path
 * does not make. Making it a hard error is also the wrong shape for a manifest
 * that is written once and consumed by two hosts with different powers: the
 * grant belongs to the host, the declaration to the extension.
 *
 * What must NOT happen is a quiet grant. The gap is recorded, `supports()`
 * answers false, and the members reject -- so an extension that does reach for
 * disk finds out immediately instead of writing into a void.
 *
 * "Granted" here describes what this host offers, not what the bundle is
 * confined to. There is no disk in a browser tab, so `granted: false` costs an
 * attacker nothing and denies a well-behaved extension a real service; it is
 * the honest answer to a manifest question, not an enforced sandbox. The
 * module header says why that distinction matters.
