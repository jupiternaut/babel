/**
 * Whether this user may author comments, from the two facts that decide it.
 *
 * The host's role-derived answer is the grant, and a server verdict that
 * refuses writes is the veto.
 *
 * This deliberately does *not* require positive write evidence from the
 * transport. `serverAccess` only reaches 'writable' when the server
 * acknowledges a `docUpdate`, and the server emits that ack in no other
 * circumstance -- so demanding it made commenting conditional on having first
 * edited the document. Opening a shared document purely to annotate it, which
 * is the whole point of the comment panel, was unreachable for every browser
 * user regardless of role.
 *
 * The residual risk is a host projection that has gone stale: an org `member`
 * whose project grant was downgraded is offered an affordance the server will
 * refuse. That is bounded and self-correcting rather than silent -- the refusal
 * arrives as `document_read_only`, which moves `serverAccess` to 'read-only'
 * and withdraws the affordance here. The two roles that must never reach it,
 * `viewer` and `guest`, are refused by the host answer itself and never depend
 * on the veto.
