/**
 * The shared collaborative comments panel.
 *
 * Editor-neutral: it is handed thread views and callbacks, and has no idea
 * whether the threads hang off Lexical marks, mockup elements, or graph nodes.
 * The owning editor decides where the panel lives (docked beside a document
 * pane, floating over a canvas) with `className`.
 *
 * Three things here are load-bearing rather than decorative:
 *
 * - **Detached threads keep a home.** Threads whose anchor is gone are grouped
 *   and explained, never filtered out. Losing the target must not lose the
 *   conversation.
 * - **Capabilities are read by the caller on every render.** A read-only
 *   viewer loses the composer and the destructive controls, and keeps every
 *   thread they could already see.
 * - **The list is a real keyboard surface.** Arrow keys move between threads
 *   with a roving tabindex, Escape closes, and focus is handed back to
 *   whatever opened the panel on unmount instead of falling to <body>.
