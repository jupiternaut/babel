/**
 * Patch/delta overrides for tracker type schemas.
 *
 * A patch expresses only the DELTA from a live builtin (or custom) seed, so a
 * caller can change one thing — add a status option, rename a label, add a field
 * — without redeclaring the whole schema. Patches are resolved against the CURRENT
 * seed at load time and on every schema-change event, so improvements to the
 * shipped builtin (new fields, new roles, prMergedStatus, …) automatically flow
 * through to an overridden type. See configurable-builtin-tracker-types plan.
 *
 * The registry always ends up holding a fully-resolved {@link TrackerDataModel},
 * so kanban columns, role derivation, inline templates, and validation all read
 * the resolved model with no per-consumer changes.
