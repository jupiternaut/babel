/**
 * Why a tracker room stopped talking to this client, when the answer is
 * permanent.
 *
 * The engine's ordinary disconnect handling is optimistic on purpose: a socket
 * that drops is assumed to be a network event and is retried with backoff
 * forever. That assumption is wrong for permanent authorization/account
 * closes, and being wrong about them is the worst-looking failure the surface
 * has -- a revoked member sits on stale rows behind a "reconnecting" chip that
 * will never resolve, because every retry is refused by the same server that
 * just refused the last one.
 *
 * `TeamTrackerRoom` distinguishes these cases in its close code, so the
 * client can too. Codes 4002 and 4003 mirror document-room removal/revocation;
 * 4004 is tracker account deletion and stays distinct from both.
