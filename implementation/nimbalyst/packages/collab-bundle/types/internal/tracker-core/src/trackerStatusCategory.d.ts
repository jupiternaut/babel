/**
 * Where a workflow status sits in the lifecycle — the one place the product
 * answers "is this item finished?".
 *
 * Before this module, terminality was a hardcoded list of status *names* in
 * `trackerCollections`, and three other lists elsewhere disagreed with it. That
 * arrangement cannot be right for more than one schema at a time: `plan` closes
 * as `completed`, `decision` as `decided`/`implemented`, `idea` as `rejected` —
 * none of which the name list knew — while `approved`, a review-lane state a
 * human has to promote past, was counted as done.
 *
 * So a status now *declares* its category (see {@link FieldOption.category}) and
 * everything else derives. Terminal is not stored; it is `done | cancelled`.
 *
 * The split inside terminal is load-bearing, not cosmetic. Finished work counts
 * toward progress; abandoned work leaves the denominator entirely, which is what
 * lets a milestone containing a cancelled item still reach 100%.
 *
 * Pure and I/O-free: callers inject their type-model lookup so independent
 * workspaces and rooms can resolve concurrently without shared registry state.
