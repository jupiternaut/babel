/**
 * Keeps the tracker grid from acting on keystrokes that were never aimed at it.
 *
 * RevoGrid's `revogr-overlay-selection` binds its key handling to a
 * document-level `keydown` listener (bubble phase) and never checks where the
 * event came from. While a cell is selected, that means typing anywhere else in
 * the app is read as grid input: a printable key calls `change(e.key)` and opens
 * the cell editor over the selected cell, so typing a prompt into a dialog
 * overwrites the title of whatever row happened to be selected behind it.
 *
 * `useExtensionInputGuard` does not cover this -- it patches
 * `window.addEventListener`, and RevoGrid registers on `document`. The
 * spreadsheet's `shouldIsolateFromGrid` does not either: it requires each text
 * input to opt in with `stopPropagation`, which an arbitrary dialog elsewhere in
 * the app has no way to know it needs to do.
 *
 * So invert it. Before running its own handler RevoGrid emits a bubbling,
 * cancelable `beforekeydown` carrying the original event, and bails when that
 * proxy is default-prevented. Listening for it on the grid container lets the
 * grid decline keys by origin, in one place, without every input in the app
 * having to defend itself.

 * which it is here: `beforekeydown` is emitted synchronously from inside the
 * document-level `keydown` listener. `contains` is the fallback for the
 * light-DOM case where the path is unavailable (jsdom, a replayed event).
 *

 * silently disable the grid's own arrow-key navigation, which is a worse failure
