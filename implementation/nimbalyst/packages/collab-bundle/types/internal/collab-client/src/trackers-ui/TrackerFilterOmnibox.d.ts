/**
 * TrackerFilterOmnibox - the one search box Tracker Mode uses everywhere.
 *
 * Greg's ask: "I want to share the text filter we use in the other view, but I
 * want to add typeahead menus to get the full power of the filter dropdown, all
 * from the keyboard input." So this box is not a second filter: it drives the
 * *same* `searchQuery` the toolbar search drove and writes into the *same*
 * persisted column-filter set the filter dropdown writes, and adds a typed
 * grammar (`trackerFilterTokens.ts`) on top so every field, operator, and value
 * in that dropdown is reachable without leaving the keyboard.
 *
 * It is mounted twice -- in the main toolbar and above the document-view list
 * pane -- differing only by `className` and `showPills`, so both surfaces behave
 * identically. `#tag` completion is part of the grammar because the toolbar box
 * it replaced had it; tags stay their own filter list (not clauses) so the
 * existing tag chips keep working.
 *
 * The input's text is `searchQuery` plus, when one is being composed, a trailing
 * filter token. Committing the token turns it into a pill and hands the clause
 * to the shared filter set; the search text it was appended to is untouched.
