/**
 * Request-level subjects, adapted to what the detail popover already accepts.
 *
 * `FeedbackArtifactDetailPopover` was built for per-option artifacts, so its
 * entries are keyed by an *entry* -- a `singleSelect` option id or a `reorder`
 * item id. A request subject has no entry: it is what the whole request is
 * about, not one of the answers to it.
 *
 * Rather than widen the popover, subjects synthesise the id they lack. The
 * popover then needs no change at all, including for the vote: it already
 * treats a missing `onSelect` as "this is not a vote, so no footer control",
 * which is exactly true of a subject.
 *
 * **The id must be stable across renders.** It keys the popover's active entry
 * and, through it, the mount that paints the artifact. An id that changed every
 * render would remount the editor every render -- the same class of bug as the
 * detail mount api that was rebuilt each pass and nulled the viewport moments
 * after the editor published it. Derived from the ref and the position, both of
 * which are stable for a given request snapshot.
