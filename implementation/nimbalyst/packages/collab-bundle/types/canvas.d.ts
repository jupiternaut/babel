/**
 * Project Canvas, as consumed by a browser host.
 *
 * Hand-authored, for the reason `editor.d.ts` is: generating this entry would
 * emit the runtime canvas declarations, and those re-export the extension SDK
 * by its bare package name through `runtime/src/extensions/editorHost` --
 * a specifier a consumer of this package does not install and cannot resolve.
 * `src/test/public-canvas-typecheck.ts` is what stops this drifting from the
 * implementation it describes.
 *
 * `EditorHostProps` is NOT restated here. It is the SDK's own declaration, the
 * same one `editor.d.ts` publishes, so `CanvasEditor` is mountable through
 * `mountExtensionEditor` without a cast -- which is the whole point of shipping
 * the canvas this way.
