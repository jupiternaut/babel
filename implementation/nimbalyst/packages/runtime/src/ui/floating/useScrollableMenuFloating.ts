/**
 * Floating config for a menu panel that must stay reachable inside the viewport.
 *
 * `flip` and `shift` cannot rescue a panel that is taller than the viewport:
 * shift clamps it against the top padding and the overflowing tail simply paints
 * past the bottom edge with no way to reach it. A workspace with many tracker
 * types pushes the card context menu's "Set Status" submenu well past 30 entries,
 * which is exactly that case.
 *
 * `size()` is the piece that fixes it — it measures the space actually left after
 * flip/shift have run and writes a `maxHeight` onto the panel, which turns the
 * panel's `overflow-y-auto` into a real scrollbar. Callers must set that overflow
 * class themselves; a max height with no overflow rule just clips.
 *
 * `autoUpdate` keeps the cap honest while the menu is open, since the window can
 * be resized (or the traffic-light band can appear) underneath it.
