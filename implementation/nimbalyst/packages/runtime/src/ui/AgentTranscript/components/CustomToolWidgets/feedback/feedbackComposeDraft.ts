/**
 * Pure draft logic for the feedback-request compose surface.
 *
 * Two things live here rather than in the widget, because they are the real
 * behaviour of this slice and a reader cannot see either one on screen:
 *
 * 1. **Tier is derived, never stored.** Tier 1 (quick ask) and Tier 2 (full
 *    request) are the same draft rendered at two disclosure levels. Promotion
 *    is a pure function of content -- a second recipient, a deadline, or a
 *    subject that is not team-visible -- so there is no mode flag to get out of
 *    sync, and demoting cannot discard what the author already entered: the
 *    fields simply stop being shown while their values stay in the draft.
 * 2. **Publishing an unshared subject is gated on an explicit confirmation
 *    that names the exact subjects.** The confirmation records the subject ids
 *    it covered, so adding another unshared subject afterwards re-blocks
 *    sending instead of silently riding along on a stale confirmation.
 *
 * Types come from `@nimbalyst/collab-protocol`; this module adds only the
 * compose-time view model (a subject's display label and shared flag are
 * presentation, not wire format) and carries no transport of its own.
