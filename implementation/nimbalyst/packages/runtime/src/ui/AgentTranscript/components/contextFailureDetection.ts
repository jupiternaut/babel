 * `context-limit` is "the conversation grew past the window"; compacting is the
 * answer. `compaction-failed` is "we tried to compact and the model refused";
 * telling that user to compact is what they just did. Before #1414 only the
 * first was recognised, so a failed compaction rendered as a bare error string
 * with no widget and no way forward -- which is how a session became
 * unrecoverable when a proxy in front of the model rejected the summarization
 * request outright.

 * below). Both are distinctive enough to match against unflagged transcript
 * text without catching an agent that merely discusses compaction in prose.
