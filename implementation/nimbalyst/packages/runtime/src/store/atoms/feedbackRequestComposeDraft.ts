 * Sent-ness, and it has to be at least as durable as the draft.
 *
 * The draft was given an atom family so the author's edits survive the
 * transcript's virtual scroller unmounting an off-screen row. Sending was left
 * in `useState`, so the *one* fact that must outlive a remount was the only one
 * that did not: coming back to the row re-seeded a pristine draft under a Send
 * button the author had already pressed, and each press created a new request.
 *
 * Kept beside the draft rather than inside it because the draft is what the
 * author is composing and this is what happened to it. A send also no longer
 * clears the draft -- an emptied atom is exactly what the seed effect treats as
 * "never composed".
