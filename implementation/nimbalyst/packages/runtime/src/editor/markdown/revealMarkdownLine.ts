/**
 * Scroll the rich markdown view to the block a file line belongs to.
 *
 * A line link (`notes.md:653`) targets source text, but the rich view has no
 * lines -- only blocks. This builds a line map from the live document, resolves
 * the line to a block, and scrolls there, flashing the block briefly so the
 * reader can see which one the link meant. Block granularity is approximate, so
 * without that marker there is no way to tell "landed on it" from "landed near
 * it".
 *
 * Silently does nothing when the line cannot be resolved. The file is already
 * open at the top, which is the intended degraded state for a stale link.
