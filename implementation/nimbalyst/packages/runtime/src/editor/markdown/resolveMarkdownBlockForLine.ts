/**
 * Resolve a file line number to the top-level block that should be revealed.
 *
 * The line map is derived by re-serializing the live document, so it is exact
 * only while that serialization matches what is on disk. Unsaved edits above
 * the target, or any construct that does not round-trip byte-identically, shift
 * every block below the drift.
 *
 * So the map is treated as a strong hint, not an answer: it picks the
 * neighborhood, then the target line's own text pins the exact block within a
 * bounded window. When the line is too plain to identify anything -- a bare
 * fence, a `---`, an empty line -- correction is skipped rather than allowed to
 * match some arbitrary block that happens to contain the same few characters.
