/**
 * React view model over a live comment source.
 *
 * Subscribes to threads through `useSyncExternalStore`, which is why
 * `getThreads` has to return a stable snapshot — `YDocCommentRepository`
 * already does. Capabilities and anchor state are read on every render and
 * deliberately never memoized: access can be revoked, and an entity can be
 * deleted, behind a source object that keeps its identity. A cached read there
 * leaves the authoring affordances decorative exactly when it matters.
