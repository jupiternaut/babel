/**
 * Re-attach comment threads whose MarkNode was lost but whose quoted text
 * survives.
 *
 * A shared document rebuilt from markdown loses every MarkNode: markdown has no
 * syntax for a comment mark, so `root.clear()` + `$convertFromMarkdown` (the
 * path agent edits take through `applyCollabDocEdit`) drops all of them while
 * leaving the thread data and the document text intact. The threads then report
 * `anchorState: 'orphaned'` and their highlights stop rendering (#2644).
 *
 * Healing is by exact quote match only. A thread whose quote was rewritten, or
 * whose quote now occurs more than once, is left orphaned on purpose — these
 * writes go into the shared Y.Doc, so a wrong guess is permanent and visible to
 * everyone.
