/**
 * Precedence for turning an `<img>` src stored in the document into something
 * the current host can actually load, for every src whose answer does not
 * depend on the DOM.
 *
 * The host resolver goes first, and that ordering is the whole point of this
 * module. `collab-asset://` used to short-circuit ahead of it because Electron
 * registers that scheme as a real protocol in main and needs the URI passed
 * through untouched -- but a browser has no such scheme, so in the web console
 * the URI reached `<img src>` verbatim and every shared-document image was
 * broken. Asking the host first lets the browser bundle claim the URI (it
 * fetches the asset and hands back a `blob:` URL) while Electron, which
 * registers no resolver, still falls through to the pass-through below.
 *
 * Relative paths and `.nimbalyst/assets/` hashes are deliberately not handled
 * here: they need the document path off the mounted DOM node, so they stay in
 * `ImageComponent`.
