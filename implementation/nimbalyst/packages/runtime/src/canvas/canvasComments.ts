/**
 * Canvas comments as data: what to draw, what to count, and what to dispatch.
 *
 * Pure throughout. It takes the canonical comment snapshot the host owns and
 * returns projections; it opens no room, writes no thread, and knows nothing
 * about React. Three things here are load-bearing.
 *
 * **Threads are not board content.** They live in the document's own `comments`
 * array, owned by the host's `CollaborationCommentsService`, and nothing in this
 * module reaches for `nodes` / `edges` / `meta`. A comment that landed in the
 * board's node map would be exported to the `.canvas` file, replayed through
 * undo, and diffed in git as if it were a card.
 *
 * **The two counts on a card are two different conversations and are never
 * added together.** A thread anchored to the card is a remark about the card's
 * place on this board -- "why is the pricing model next to the PRD?" A thread
 * inside the card's own document is a remark about that document's contents,
 * lives in that document's comment room, and is visible to people who have
 * never seen this board. Summing them would produce a number that answers no
 * question and quietly merges two audiences. `CanvasCardCommentCounts` keeps
 * them as separate fields, `inDocument` is nullable so "unknown" cannot be
 * mistaken for "none", and there is deliberately no `total` anywhere.
 *
 * **An `@agent` reply is offered to exactly one client: the one the comment
 * claims wrote it.** Every client with the board open sees the same comment
 * arrive, so a rule any of them could act on would raise N prompts for one
 * request. That is a routing rule and nothing more -- see the trust note over
 * `canvasPendingAgentRequests` for why the claim it routes on can never be the
 * thing that authorizes a session.

 * The `@agent` asks this client should *offer* to start a session for.
 *
 * **Nothing here authorizes anything.** A comment's `actor` is ordinary shared
 * document data: `createCommentSharedMap` writes it into the Y.Map verbatim, and
 * the collab server authenticates who submitted an opaque update rather than
 * interpreting what the update claims. A teammate with a protocol-capable client
 * can therefore publish a comment carrying somebody else's member id and any
 * body they like. Treating `actor.userId` as authorship is what turned an
 * `@agent` mention into "run a prompt of my choosing on your machine, in your
 * workspace, with your permissions."
 *
 * So the match on `viewerUserId` below is a *routing* rule and only that: every
 * client with the board open sees the same comment, and without it one ask would
 * raise a prompt on all of them. The thing that decides whether a session starts
 * is the person at the keyboard confirming it -- see `useCanvasComments`, which
 * hands these to the surface as pending asks and calls the host's dispatch only
 * from a click. A forged actor can therefore put a dialog in front of somebody;
 * it cannot start anything. The prompt itself still fences the body, because a
 * confirmed request is not the same thing as trustworthy text
 * (`canvasAgentDispatchPrompt`).
 *
 * Resolved threads are skipped: reopening work someone already closed is not
 * what the mention meant. Agent-authored comments are skipped outright, so a
 * session that writes "@agent" into its own reply cannot ask for another one.
