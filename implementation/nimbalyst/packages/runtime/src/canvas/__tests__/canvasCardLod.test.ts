   * The Agent-mode transition. Nimbalyst keeps every mode component mounted and
   * hides the inactive pane with `display: none`, and an element in that subtree
   * measures 0x0 -- so `IntersectionObserver` reports a confident
   * `isIntersecting: false` for every card on the board.
   *
   * Taken at face value that is "cold everything", which unmounts every editor
   * and drops every room each time the user glances at a transcript, and rebuilds
   * them all on the way back. This asserts the frozen behaviour instead, and it
   * asserts it by *identity*: returning the previous map unchanged is the
   * mechanism by which React does not re-render, so `toBe` is the assertion that
   * actually catches a remount storm. `toEqual` would pass on a map that had been
   * rebuilt from scratch.
