/**
 * The board's comment composer, in its own module so it can be fetched late.
 *
 * Split out of `CanvasCommentsLayer` for a bundle reason, not a code-structure
 * one. `CommentComposer` brings the mention picker, and the mention picker
 * brings `@floating-ui/react`; a static edge from the layer put both in the
 * `./canvas` entry's *eager* graph, so opening a board downloaded the composer
 * for every reader who never wrote a comment. It measured at ~42 kB gzip of the
 * entry, which is what pushed the entry over its ceiling.
 *
 * Nothing else on the board reaches for the composer: pins, badges and the card
 * comments context are cheap and stay eager, because a card renders its badge
 * on first paint. The composer only ever mounts after a deliberate gesture --
 * "comment on this card", or a click on empty board with the comment tool armed
 * -- which is exactly the point at which a fetch is free. `CanvasSurface` holds
 * the `lazy()` wrapper; import this module directly only from a test.
