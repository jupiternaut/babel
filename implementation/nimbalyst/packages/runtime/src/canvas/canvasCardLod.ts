/**
 * Level of detail for the cards that mount a real editor.
 *
 * A document has a handful of embeds in a linear scroll and can afford to mount
 * all of them; a board has thirty in a plane and zooming out puts every one of
 * them on screen at once. So a reference card is in one of three states:
 *
 * - **cold** -- a DOM summary drawn by the canvas itself. No extension code
 *   loaded, no collab room connected.
 * - **warm** -- the real editor, mounted read-only and pointer-inert. Safe at
 *   any zoom: every rendering measurement in the NIM-3845 spike was exactly
 *   linear in k, and every failure was in pointer-to-content mapping, which an
 *   inert card cannot reach.
 * - **hot** -- the real editor, editable and focusable. Exactly one at a time,
 *   entered by clicking into the card, and only ever at scale 1.0.
 *
 * This module is the whole policy, as a pure function, for the reason
 * `canvasFlowMapping` is pure: the parts that are genuinely regression-prone
 * here are invisible on screen. "Does returning from Agent mode remount thirty
 * editors" is not a thing you can see by looking at a board.
 *
 * THE HIDDEN-SURFACE DECISION, which is the non-obvious one:
 *
 * Nimbalyst keeps every mode component mounted and toggles them with CSS
 * `display`. In Agent mode the entire editor pane is `display: none`, and inside
 * that subtree the React Flow root, every node wrapper, and every handle measure
 * 0x0. `IntersectionObserver` reports nothing intersecting -- not "unknown", but
 * a positive `isIntersecting: false` for every card.
 *
 * Taken at face value that signal says "cold everything," which would tear down
 * thirty editors and thirty rooms every time the user glances at Agent mode, and
 * rebuild them all on the way back. The opposite reading -- ignore it and keep
 * promoting -- is no better, because a hidden board would keep warming cards it
 * has no idea are on screen.
 *
 * So a hidden surface **freezes**: the previous assignment is returned verbatim,
 * no promotion and no demotion, and the surface additionally refuses to fold
 * intersection updates observed while hidden. Nothing unmounts, so returning to
 * Files mode is a no-op rather than a remount storm, and a board the user left
 * ten seconds ago is exactly as warm as they left it. The cost is that a hidden
 * board holds its rooms open; that is bounded by the warm cap and released when
 * the tab closes, and it is the cheaper of the two mistakes.
