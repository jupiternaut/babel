/**
 * All of the board's comment wiring in one place: the thread projection, the
 * anchor adapter the platform resolves through, the dual counts, and the
 * `@agent` dispatch.
 *
 * What this deliberately does NOT do is render a thread, a reply box, or a
 * resolve button. Those belong to the host's comments panel
 * (`CollaborativeCommentsPanel`, docked by `CollabCommentsPanelDock`), which
 * every collaborative extension tab already gets, and which owns grouping,
 * detached threads, mentions, keyboard navigation, deletion, and the
 * agent-session link. The canvas owns exactly two things the panel cannot know:
 * where a thread sits on the board, and how to bring it into view.
 *
 * The host `comments` service is optional and its absence is not an error. A
 * board opened outside a collaborative room -- a private `.canvas` file, which
 * is the common case -- has no comment room, so it has no comments. It must not
 * fall back to a local simulation: a comment that looked shared and was not is
 * worse than a missing button.
