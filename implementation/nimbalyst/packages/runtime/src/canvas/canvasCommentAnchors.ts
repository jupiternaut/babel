/**
 * Where a canvas comment thread is anchored.
 *
 * Two kinds, both `EntityCommentAnchor` -- no new member of the `CommentAnchor`
 * union, and no new field on it. That is a decision, not an omission:
 *
 * **Card comments** name the node: `{ entityType: 'canvas-node', entityId }`.
 * The node already exists in the board's own Y.Doc, so the anchor needs to
 * carry nothing but its id. Moving, resizing, restyling, or re-parenting the
 * card never touches it; deleting the card orphans it and the conversation
 * survives with its `labelSnapshot` still readable.
 *
 * **Pin comments** name the point: `{ entityType: 'canvas-point', entityId:
 * '<x>,<y>' }`, in board coordinates. The alternative -- a new `canvas-point`
 * anchor *kind*, or a companion pin record in the document -- was rejected on
 * two counts.
 *
 * A new kind is a change to `CommentAnchor`, which is public SDK surface shared
 * with the collab bundle, the web console, the MCP comment tools, and the
 * validator that decides which anchors a *newer* client may have written. Every
 * one of those would have to learn the kind before a pin could round-trip, and
 * an older client would treat it as `unsupported` rather than as something it
 * merely cannot draw. An entity anchor degrades far better: any client can
 * still read the thread, list it, reply to it, and say what it points at.
 *
 * A companion record is worse still, and MockupLM is the proof. Its pins live
 * in a `mockupPins` map next to the HTML, which forces a two-write creation
 * ordered pin-then-thread, a compensating rollback when the thread is refused,
 * a garbage collector for pins whose thread never landed, a grace period to
 * keep that collector from eating healthy pins during a partial sync, and a
 * hydration gate nothing has ever been able to wire. All of it exists because
 * the geometry and the thread are two objects that can disagree. Coordinates in
 * the anchor make them one object: the thread is the pin. There is nothing to
 * roll back, nothing to collect, and nothing to leak.
 *
 * The cost is that a pin cannot be dragged -- its coordinates are its identity,
 * so moving one would mean rewriting an anchor the comment protocol writes
 * once. That is the right trade for what a pin is for ("this whole cluster
 * needs work"), and re-anchoring is a feature the protocol would have to grow
 * anyway, for every editor, not a thing to pre-buy here.
 *
 * Consequence worth stating: **a pin is never orphaned.** A point in the plane
 * exists whether or not anything is drawn near it. Only card anchors can
 * orphan, and that is the case the tests are about.
