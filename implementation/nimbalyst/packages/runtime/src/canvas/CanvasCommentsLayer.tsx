/**
 * The board's share of the comment UI: pins, card badges, and a composer.
 *
 * Everything else -- the thread list, replies, mentions, resolve, delete, the
 * detached group, the agent-session link -- is the host's comments panel, which
 * this reaches through `service.openPanel`. Nothing in this file renders a
 * thread, and nothing in it should start to. If a comment needs a new control,
 * it belongs in `CollaborativeCommentsPanel`, where every editor gets it.
 *
 * Positioning notes, both consequences of NIM-3845:
 *
 * - **Pins live in `ViewportPortal`,** so their coordinates are plain board
 *   coordinates and they pan and zoom with the cards they annotate. The marker
 *   counter-scales so it stays legible and clickable at any zoom. A plain
 *   `<button>` under a CSS transform hit-tests correctly -- the spike's failure
 *   was libraries deriving content coordinates from `getBoundingClientRect`,
 *   which nothing here does.
 * - **The composer is a React Flow `Panel`,** outside the transform entirely.
 *   A textarea rendered on the board would be 6px tall at half zoom, and its
 *   mention picker would be the one popover on this surface that had to reason
 *   about scale. Screen space is simply the right space for a form.
