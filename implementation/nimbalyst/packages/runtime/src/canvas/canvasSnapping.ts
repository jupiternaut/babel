/**
 * Magnetic alignment for a dragged canvas card.
 *
 * Pure geometry on purpose. A guide is one SVG line, so its correctness is
 * entirely in the numbers behind it -- the alignment and equal-spacing cases are
 * fiddly, invisible to a reader, and untestable through the DOM. Everything that
 * decides *where the card lands* lives here; the surface only observes a drag and
 * draws what comes back.
 *
 * **The grid is not implemented here.** React Flow snaps a dragged node's
 * position to `snapGrid` before it emits a position change, so by the time this
 * function runs the incoming position is already on the grid and any alignment
 * match is a deliberate override of it. A second grid implementation that
 * disagreed with React Flow's by one rounding step would be worse than none.
 * `snapCanvasNodeToGrid` exists only for the one case React Flow does not cover:
 * a card created from the toolbar, which never goes through a drag.
 *
 * **Guides are transient view state and never touch the document.** They are
 * returned alongside the position rather than stored, so there is no path by
 * which one reaches the Y.Doc, the file, or undo history.

 * Alignment reach in *screen* pixels, not canvas units.
 *
 * The pull has to feel identical at every zoom, so the surface divides this by
 * the current scale before calling in. A threshold in canvas units would be
 * unusable at 10% zoom (an 8px reach covering 80 screen pixels) and unreachable
 * at 200%.
 *
 * **It must stay larger than half the grid step, and that is not a style
 * choice.** React Flow quantises the drag to `snapGrid` before this function
 * ever sees it, so the position handed in is up to `CANVAS_SNAP_GRID / 2` away
 * from where the pointer actually is. A neighbour edge sitting off-grid -- the
 * centre line of a 300-wide card, say -- would then be rounded out of reach and
 * the card would simply refuse to line up, with nothing on screen to explain
 * why. Twelve leaves two pixels of slack over the ten the grid can eat.
