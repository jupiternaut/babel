/**
 * Canvas document <-> React Flow mapping.
 *
 * Pure: no React, no DOM, and `@xyflow/react` enters only as erased types. The
 * surface is a thin shell over this module on purpose -- the parts of a canvas
 * that are genuinely regression-prone are invisible on screen (z-order derived
 * from rank, the integer geometry boundary, and turning React Flow's change
 * stream back into document edits), so they live here where a node-environment
 * test can reach them without mounting anything.
 *
 * Every function returns the *same* document object when a change is a no-op,
 * and preserves the identity of untouched nodes. Callers rely on that: it is
 * what keeps a drag from marking every other card dirty, and what lets React
 * skip re-rendering cards nobody moved.
