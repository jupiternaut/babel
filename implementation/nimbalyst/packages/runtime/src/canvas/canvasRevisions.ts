/**
 * Screen inventory over time: which revision a card shows, and who made it.
 *
 * Two facts make this cheap, and both are older than this module. A canvas card
 * is a *reference*, not a copy -- so pinning one to a past revision is a change
 * to a string on a node, not a copy of any content. And `CanvasDocumentTarget`
 * has carried an optional `revisionId` since Slice 1, so the format already says
 * "this card is the login screen as of revision 7" without a second mechanism.
 *
 * Everything here is a pure function over data the host hands in. The canvas
 * cannot list revisions itself -- that is an authenticated request against the
 * document's room -- and it must not learn how, for the same reason it does not
 * know how to resolve an extension: `./canvas` ships to the web console, where
 * the transport is a different object. The host fills `canvasCallbacks.revisions`
 * and this module decides what the answers *mean*.
 *
 * **There is deliberately no restore in this slice.** Pinning a revision adds a
 * new card that points at it; nothing here writes a revision back over live
 * content, and no function in this file returns a document with an existing
 * node's target rewritten. That is not an oversight to be filled in later by
 * whoever needs it -- restore-over-head is a destructive path
 * (`.claude/rules/destructive-data-paths.md`) and it needs the retry, the
 * verification, and the recoverable artifact that rule requires. Pin-as-a-new-
 * card is the safe primitive that makes the destructive one unnecessary for the
 * thing people actually want, which is comparing v3 against v7 side by side.

/**
 * Join room-reported revisions to locally-known sessions and commits.
 *
 * The interesting rule is attribution, and it is a *window*, not a nearest

 * previous one, so the session credited with revision N is the last one that
 * edited the content strictly after revision N-1 was captured and at or before
 * N was. An edit older than the previous revision already belongs to that
 * revision; crediting it again would put the same session's name on every
 * revision after it forever, which is the failure mode a nearest-timestamp
 * match walks straight into.
 *
 * Anything outside the window attributes to nothing. A revision a person saved
 * by hand, in a document no session has touched, honestly carries only its
 * author -- inventing a session for it would make the whole rail untrustworthy
 * for the case it exists to serve.
 *
 * The commit is likewise the *first* one the attributed session landed at or
 * after the snapshot: the commit that shipped this content. Later commits by
 * the same long-running session shipped something else.
 *
 * `revisions` may arrive in any order; the result is newest first, and
