/**
 * withHeadlessLexicalBridge
 *
 * Run `fn` against a headless Lexical editor holding `yDoc`'s content, with
 * edits flowing back into `yDoc`.
 *
 * Binds to a FRESH working doc and replays `yDoc`'s state into it, rather than
 * binding to `yDoc` directly. This is the same editor-doc bridge
 * `CollabLexicalProvider` uses in the renderer, and it exists for the same
 * reason (its FAILURE HISTORY note 1, NIM-1764): a binding only builds its
 * collab tree from updates it observes, so binding straight to an
 * already-populated doc yields an EMPTY editor state.
 *
 * That emptiness was silent and destructive: `exportToFile` / `toPlainText`
 * returned '' for every non-empty document, and a `$getRoot().clear()` was a
 * no-op against content the editor had never seen.
 *
 * The NODE SET is the caller's choice and it matters. The main process has no
 * extension graph, so it must pass the minimal `HeadlessBodyNodes` -- with
 * anything less registered, a list- or link-bearing document throws "Node list
 * is not registered" mid-import and leaves the Y.Doc empty. The renderer has
 * the full graph and should pass it, so a headless edit sees exactly what the
 * mounted editor would.
