/**
 * The collaborative codec for the built-in `code` document type.
 *
 * Moved out of the electron renderer because the web console needs the exact
 * same object. Three of its fields are load-bearing across hosts and must not
 * be restated anywhere:
 *
 *   - `documentType: 'code'` is what a shared document's index row records, and
 *     what each host's document-type catalog matches on.
 *   - `textField: 'content'` is the Y.Text a Monaco model binds to. A host that
 *     bound a different field would sync cleanly against itself and show an
 *     empty document to everyone else.
 *   - `fileExtensions` decides which suffixes resolve to this type at all.
 *
 * A second copy would compile, pass its own tests, and diverge silently. That
 * is the failure this file exists to make impossible.

// that specifier is aliased to a small browser bridge that deliberately does
// not provide those components. Importing the barrel here therefore fails the
// console's production build with a missing export, from a module that only
// wanted one pure factory function.
