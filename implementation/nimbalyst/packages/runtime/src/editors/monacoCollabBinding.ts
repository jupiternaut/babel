/**
 * createMonacoCollabBinding
 *
 * Reusable live binding between a Monaco editor model and a Yjs `Y.Text`,
 * built on `y-monaco`'s `MonacoBinding`. Any Monaco-based custom editor
 * (calc-sheets, future code/source editors) can become collaborative by:
 *
 *   1. registering a text adapter (`createTextCollabContentAdapter` from
 *      `@nimbalyst/extension-sdk`) for the SAME `Y.Text` field, and
 *   2. calling this from `useCollaborativeEditor`'s `createBinding` once the
 *      editor instance is mounted.
 *
 * `MonacoBinding` reconciles Monaco's model edits with the shared `Y.Text`
 * (character-level CRDT merge) and renders remote selections via the optional
 * `awareness`. The returned handle's `destroy()` detaches everything; call it
 * from the binding teardown so observers and awareness listeners are cleaned
 * up on unmount.

/**
 * Wrap an awareness so its `change` listeners run on a microtask instead of
 * synchronously.
 *
 * `MonacoBinding` calls `awareness.setLocalStateField('selection', ...)` from
 * Monaco's cursor-selection event, and awareness emits `change` synchronously,
 * so y-monaco's remote-cursor repaint (`deltaDecorations`) lands inside
 * whatever decoration change produced that selection event -- Monaco's own
 * WordHighlighter clearing its decorations is the usual one. Monaco reports the
 * nested call through `onUnexpectedError` ("Invoking deltaDecorations
 * recursively could lead to leaking decorations"), which reaches the user as an
 * uncaught error even though the decorations still apply. Deferring the repaint
 * takes it out of that window; remote cursors are a frame later, which is
 * imperceptible.
 *
 * Only `change` is deferred. Everything else -- `getStates`, `setLocalStateField`,
 * other events -- passes straight through, bound to the real awareness so no
 * internal `this` ever sees the wrapper.
