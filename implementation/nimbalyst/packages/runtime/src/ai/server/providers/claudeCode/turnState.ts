/**
 * Per-turn mutable state for `ClaudeCodeProvider.sendMessage()`.
 *
 * `sendMessage` is one async generator whose chunk loop writes a pile of locals
 * that its epilogue then reads: `completeEmitted` / `fullContent` /
 * `toolCallCount` together decide whether an empty slash command reports an
 * error, `sawAssistantOutputThisTurn` gates the crash-retry, `stderrLines`
 * enriches the error message. Splitting the method means those locals have to
 * cross a function boundary, and passing them by value would break the epilogue
 * silently — the turn would still stream text, it would just stop completing
 * correctly.
 *
 * So they live here instead, in one object created at the top of the turn and
 * threaded by reference into every extracted piece.
 *
 * This is deliberately NOT hung off `ClaudeCodeProvider`. A provider instance is
 * reused across turns; anything promoted to instance state leaks into the next
 * turn. Instance fields on the provider (`drainingBackgroundTasks`,
 * `promptEndTimer`, …) are the ones that intentionally outlive a turn or are
 * read by `abort()` from outside it — those stay where they are.
