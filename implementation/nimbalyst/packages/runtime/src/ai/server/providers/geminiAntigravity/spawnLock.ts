/**
 * Cross-process spawn lock for the Antigravity language server.
 *
 * The language server is a shared model endpoint bound to one --app_data_dir
 * and one ~/.gemini OAuth, not a per-instance resource. Whenever two Nimbalyst
 * processes can start a turn at the same time -- a second dev instance
 * (`npm run dev:user2`), a packaged build running alongside dev, or the app
 * restarting while the old process is still winding down -- both can miss
 * discovery during the spawn window and each launch their own server. The pair
 * then contend on that shared state until GetModelResponse times out. Exactly
 * one process spawns; the rest discover and attach.
 *
 * These are file-lock primitives (an exclusive 'wx' create is atomic across
 * processes). A lock older than staleMs is treated as abandoned (its holder
 * crashed mid-spawn) and stolen.
 */
