/**
 * Classification of abnormal `claude` subprocess exits (GitHub #1361).
 *
 * When the bundled CLI dies from a native fault it produces no stream-json
 * output and usually no stderr at all -- the SDK's only signal is the raw
 * wait status, which reaches the transcript verbatim as
 * `Claude Code process exited with code 3221225477`. In #1361 that happened on
 * ~80% of spawns on Windows 11 x64 and the reporter had nothing to go on but
 * the integer.
 *
 * `isBunRuntimeSpawnCrash` (see spawnCrashDiagnostics.ts) does not cover this:
 * it requires Bun's `"An unknown error occurred"` stderr line, which a native
 * fault never gets far enough to print.
 *
 * The decision is a pure function on purpose. A native crash can only be
 * produced by an environment we cannot reproduce on a maintainer machine, so
 * the classification and the retry policy are tested here on the facts rather
 * than in the provider where they would never execute under observation.
