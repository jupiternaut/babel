/**
 * Declared file-tracking contract per provider.
 *
 * Two decisions used to be hardcoded string comparisons against a single
 * provider id, in the middle of the streaming handler:
 *
 * ```ts
 * if (providerName !== 'openai-codex') return 'fuzzy';
 * const isOpenCodeEdit = OPENCODE_EDIT_TOOLS.includes(name) && session.provider === 'opencode';
 * const isCodexAcpEdit = CODEX_ACP_EDIT_TOOLS.includes(name) && session.provider === 'openai-codex-acp';
 * ```
 *
 * Both shapes grow one branch per provider, and both were already wrong in the
 * same way: `'disabled'` attribution reads as a Codex privilege when it is
 * simply what any provider earns by reporting authoritative structured file
 * changes. Adding a provider to `AI_PROVIDER_TYPES` now breaks these exhaustive
 * records until the provider says, in one place, what it can actually report.
 */

/**
 * How well a provider reports the files it changed.
 *
 * - `'structured'`: the transport emits an authoritative change item carrying
 *   the path plus a diff (or old/new text), with moves and deletes
 *   distinguishable from writes. Filesystem-watcher attribution is redundant
 *   and must be switched off so it cannot contradict the real data.
 * - `'tool-args'`: no change item, but edits arrive as tool calls whose
 *   arguments name the path before the write lands. Good enough for a pre-edit
 *   baseline; the watcher still runs to catch edits made any other way
 *   (shell commands, sub-agents).
 * - `'none'`: nothing usable. The watcher is the only source, and every
 *   attribution is inferred.

 * transport, which has no `fileChange` item.
 *
 * Chat providers have no file-editing tools of their own, so they report
