 * Two families of wording, both prose-only because the harness attaches no
 * structured marker to either:
 *
 * - Bash / sub-agents (NIM-1470, NIM-1556): "Command did not complete within
 *   its 120s timeout and was moved to the background (ID: …)", "Task is now
 *   running in the background", "Async agent launched successfully…".
 * - MCP tool calls (#1341, harness symbol `callMcpToolWithAutoBackground`,
 *   default 120s): `MCP tool "<server> - <tool> (MCP)" is still running after
 *   120s. It was moved to the background as task <id> and keeps running; …`.
 *
 * The wording has been widened twice already, so match loosely and let callers
 * decide how much to trust it.
