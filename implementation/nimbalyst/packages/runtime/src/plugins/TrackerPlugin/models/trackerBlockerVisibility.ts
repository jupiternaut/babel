/**
 * How a readiness verdict is projected to a caller who cannot see every blocker.
 *
 * Readiness is computed over the FULL unfiltered corpus and must stay that way
 * -- deriving it after a caller's filters have run turns satisfied blockers into
 * dangling ids and reports blocked work as ready. But the explanation that
 * leaves the computation is a different question from the computation itself: a
 * caller asking for bugs should not be handed the title and private reference of
 * an archived plan it filtered out, and on the tool surface a blocker title is
 * attacker-influenced free text landing in an agent's context.
 *
 * So the verdict survives intact and the identifying detail does not. Both the
 * MCP projection and the grid chip call `projectBlockedBy`, because two copies
 * of this rule is how the surfaces come to disagree about what is safe to show.

/**
 * The part of a caller's query that partitions the corpus rather than selects

 *
 * Type and archive scope carve the tracker into disjoint sets the caller chose
 * not to look at. `search` / `status` / `priority` / `where` narrow within a set
 * the caller is already looking at, and are deliberately absent: redacting on
 * those would strip almost every blocker of the explanation it exists to give,
 * since a blocker rarely matches the same search text as its dependent.
 *
 * An empty scope spans everything, so nothing is redacted -- the right default
 * for a caller that never narrowed.

 * "waiting on something nobody has started" stay distinguishable.
 *
 * What does not survive is identity. `title` is free text belonging to an item
 * the caller did not ask for. `ref` is worse: for an unshared item it is this
 * machine's private dotted number, which resolves to nothing -- or to a
 * different item -- for any other reader.
 *
 * `itemId` stays. It is opaque, it is already the universal handle in this API,
 * and keeping it means the caller can widen its own filters and fetch the item
 * deliberately. That second call is a scope decision the caller makes, which is
 * exactly the thing the accidental disclosure was not.
