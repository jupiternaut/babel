/**
 * nonRenderingFrames -- the single classification of provider frames that
 * produce no transcript event, ever.
 *
 * Three separate consumers need this answer and used to each keep their own
 * copy:
 *
 *   1. the local storage gate  (`isTransientClaudeCodeChunk`, provider write path)
 *   2. the sync wire gate      (`syncContentTruncator`)
 *   3. the storage backfill    (`toolOutputRetentionPass`'s prune lane)
 *
 * They drifted, and the drift was expensive. The sync copy listed
 * `thinking_tokens` with a written justification -- "live progress ticks, they
 * drive an in-memory indicator only and produce no descriptor on reparse" --
 * and the storage copy did not. On the measured install that one missing entry
 * was 325,585 rows, 121,871 of them written in a single month: 44% of every
 * claude-code row that month, for a counter that reads
 * `{"estimated_tokens":250,"estimated_tokens_delta":100}`. Conversely the
 * storage copy listed `task_updated` and the sync copy did not, so the same
 * frame was dead weight on disk and live on the wire.
 *
 * Everything below is derived from the READ path, which is what makes it safe
 * to delete against. `ClaudeCodeRawParser` handles exactly one system subtype
 * (`permission_denied`); `CodexAppServerRawParser` ignores the delta methods
 * entirely. If you add a branch to either parser, remove the corresponding
 * entry here in the same commit -- a frame that renders must never appear in
 * this file.
 *
 * NOT in scope here: frames that render nothing but are kept on purpose.
 * `system/init` and `system/compact_boundary` produce no transcript event yet
 * stay persisted for forensics (init carries the SDK session id and the
 * tool/MCP context). Those belong to the caller's own policy, not to this
 * module's "never renders" answer.

 * questions. A status notification renders nothing and is superseded by
 * nothing, so "does it render" settles it. A delta renders nothing only
 * BECAUSE a later frame holds the same content -- and a turn the user cancelled
 * or whose CLI died never wrote that frame, leaving the delta as the only copy
 * of what the assistant said. A destructive path may only act on a delta once
 * it has found the matching `item/completed`; see `rawMessagePrune`.
 *
 * Both carry `params.itemId`, and `item/completed` carries `params.item.id`, so
 * that proof is exact per item rather than per session. They stopped being
 * written when the write-path filter landed; the rows they left behind are what
 * the prune lane clears.
