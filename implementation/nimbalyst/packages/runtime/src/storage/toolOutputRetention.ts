/**
 * toolOutputRetention -- rewrite aged tool output into a tombstone.
 *
 * Layer 2 of the storage plan. `toolOutputBudget` bounds what a NEW message
 * costs; this reclaims what is already on disk. On the measured install, tool
 * results older than 30 days were 3.1 GB of a 7.1 GB table.
 *
 * The transcript is projected from raw messages on read (migration 0005
 * dropped the canonical events table), so raw is the only copy. We therefore
 * rewrite the payload rather than deleting the row: the tool card still
 * renders in sequence with its name, arguments and success/error status, and
 * only the output body reads as discarded. Deleting the row instead would make
 * the call render as though it never returned.
 *
 * This module is pure -- it takes a content string and returns a content
 * string. Row selection, batching and lane discipline are the driver's job
 * (see `toolOutputRetentionPass` in the electron package). Keeping the rewrite
 * pure is what lets a test assert that a tombstoned row still parses to the
 * same transcript event shape.

 * The row records `tool_use_id` but NOT the tool name -- that lives on the
 * separate `nimbalyst_tool_use` row -- so a per-row pure rewrite cannot tell an
 * answer from a database dump. Discriminating by size or by sniffing the body
 * would be destroying user data on a heuristic, which
 * `.claude/rules/destructive-data-paths.md` forbids. We decline the whole shape
 * until a driver can join the call row and supply the name. That leaves real
 * bytes unreclaimed; losing a user's answers is not a trade worth making.
 *
 * `claudeThinkingSignature` -- not tool output, and it wants deletion rather
