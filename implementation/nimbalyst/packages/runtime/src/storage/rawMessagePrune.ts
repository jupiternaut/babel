/**
 * rawMessagePrune -- decide whether a raw message row renders nothing at all
 * and can therefore be deleted outright.
 *
 * ## Why deletion, when the retention pass deliberately never deletes
 *
 * `toolOutputRetention` tombstones a row's PAYLOAD and keeps the row, because
 * the tool card must still render in sequence -- deleting it would make the
 * call look like it never returned. That reasoning applies to a row the
 * transcript renders. It does not apply to a row the transcript has no branch
 * for: a `thinking_tokens` progress tick or a superseded `item/agentMessage/
 * delta` produces no canonical event whether it is present, tombstoned, or
 * absent. For those, tombstoning is strictly worse than deleting -- it keeps
 * the row's fixed cost and reclaims only its (already tiny) content.
 *
 * That fixed cost is the whole point. On the measured install
 * `ai_agent_messages` carries four full-table indexes costing 167 bytes of
 * index per row before any content, plus b-tree overhead. A 195-byte
 * `thinking_tokens` row costs roughly 400 bytes all-in. 325,585 of them were on
 * disk. No payload rewrite can touch that; only removing the row can.
 *
 * ## What makes this safe to delete against
 *
 * `.claude/rules/destructive-data-paths.md` requires that a destructive
 * decision be verified from a signal OUTSIDE the thing being operated on, and
 * never made by sniffing content for a heuristic. So:
 *
 *   - Every predicate here is imported from the READ path -- the parsers and
 *     the shared `nonRenderingFrames` classification they feed. Nothing in this
 *     file decides for itself what renders. If a parser grows a branch for a
 *     frame, the entry disappears from the shared set and this function stops
 *     proposing it, in the same commit.
 *   - The headless classifier is the one predicate the read path cannot enforce
 *     structurally, because `HeadlessAgentRawParser` renders nothing for those
 *     frames by falling THROUGH its mapper rather than by consulting a set. It
 *     must never be wired into the parser to close that gap: a classifier the
 *     read path obeys would make a new `projectEvent` branch silently dead and
 *     keep this module deleting the frames it was written to render -- the
 *     "verification never trusts the source it is verifying" failure. The
 *     coupling is proven by test instead; see `rawMessagePrune.test.ts`.
 *   - The classification is a frame's own `type` / `method` discriminator --
 *     its schema, not an inference about its contents. Size, age and body text
 *     are never consulted.
 *   - Default is DENY. An unrecognized source, an unparseable body, or a
 *     recognized frame that is not in a shared set all return `null`.
 *   - "Renders nothing" is necessary but not always sufficient. A reason in
 *     `PRUNE_REASON_SUPERSESSION_PROOF` rests on a later row holding the same
 *     content, which a row cannot attest to by itself; the driver must prove it,
 *     scoped to the turn or the item, before deleting.
 *   - "The turn-final row already holds this content" is a claim about a
 *     specific writer, and it is only checked here for content that writer
 *     actually stores. It stores assistant TEXT and nothing else, so reasoning
 *     deltas are not classified prunable at any age -- see `PruneReason`.
 *
 * This module is pure: content string in, prune reason or null out. Row
 * selection, batching and lane discipline belong to the driver
 * (`rawMessagePrunePass` in the electron package), which is also what reports
 * the per-reason breakdown -- a prune that cannot say what it removed and why
 * is not auditable.

/**
 * How a "superseded by a later row" reason must be PROVEN before it is acted
 * on. A reason absent from this map needs no proof: it renders nothing and
 * nothing supersedes it, so the row's own shape settles it.
 *
 *   - `codexItemCompleted` -- an `item/completed` row exists LATER in the same
 *     session whose `params.item.id` equals this delta's `params.itemId`. Codex
 *     stamps both, so the proof is exact per item.
 *   - `headlessTurnFinal` -- an `item.completed` row exists later in the same
 *     session and source, and BEFORE the next input row. The headless providers
 *     stamp no turn or item id on a delta, so the turn's own boundaries are the
 *     finest identity available: an input row is where a turn begins, and this
 *     lane never deletes one (it selects `direction = 'output'` only), so the
 *     boundary cannot be destroyed by the pass that depends on it.
 *
 * Why per-turn and not per-session. `HeadlessCliAgentProvider` writes the
 * turn-final `item.completed` from one place: the `case 'complete':` branch,
 * guarded on `sessionId && fullText`. A turn that never reaches `complete` --
 * the user cancels via `abortSignal`, the CLI dies mid-stream, or the
 * best-effort store throws into its bare `catch {}` -- stores no final message,
 * and its deltas are then the ONLY surviving record of what the assistant said,
 * with no server-side copy. "A later `item.completed` exists in this session"
 * does NOT establish that: for completed turn A, cancelled turn B, completed
 * turn C, C's row is later than B's deltas and would vouch for them. Only C's
 * OWN turn is entitled to C's completion.
 *
 * Reasoning deltas appear nowhere in this map because they are no longer
 * classified prunable at all. The provider's `fullText` accumulates `case
 * 'text':` only -- its `case 'reasoning':` is a bare `break` -- so the
 * synthesized `item.completed` holds assistant text and nothing else. A
 * reasoning delta is the sole copy of the agent's thinking even for a turn that
 * completed perfectly, which is the opposite of superseded, and it is exactly
 * the content a user scrolls back for. If a final reasoning record is ever
 * persisted, that is the commit that may reintroduce the reason.
