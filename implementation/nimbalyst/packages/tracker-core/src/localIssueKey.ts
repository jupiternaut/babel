 * The `NIM-###` namespace (or whatever the room's prefix is) belongs to the
 * tracker room and to nothing else. A client that mints into it is guessing,
 * and two clients guessing independently is how the same shared item ended up
 * under different room-owned keys on two clients: every create path
 * allocated a local `MAX(issue_number)+1` before the mutation was acked, and
 * the loser never converged.
 *
 * A synced item therefore carries an `LC-###` key between creation and the
 * ack. It is visibly not a real issue key, so nobody pastes it into a commit
 * message expecting `CommitTrackerLinker` to resolve it, and it never occupies
 * `issue_number` -- the column the room owns.

 * and `PROJ-12` cannot be confused, and telling them apart costs a regex rather
 * than a database lookup. That matters because local numbers do not stay
 * local: an agent handed one writes it into a commit message, and the only
 * property worth guaranteeing is that the escaped number fails loudly instead
 * of resolving to some other item.
 *
 * Length could not do this job. The room's prefix-conflict path already hands
 * back longer alternatives (NIM taken -> NIMA), so "local prefixes are longer"
 * would collide with real team keys.
