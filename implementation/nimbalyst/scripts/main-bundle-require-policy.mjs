/**
 * Policy for how the Electron main-process bundle may use `require`.
 *
 * Two related hazards, both of which have shipped:
 *
 * 1. `conf` (via electron-store) contains `delete require.cache[__filename]`.
 *    In its own module that removes only conf's entry. Inlined into our bundle,
 *    `__filename` is the main entry, so the entry evicts ITSELF from the module
 *    cache during startup.
 * 2. Rollup splits any dynamic `import()` reached from main into a lazy chunk,
 *    and those chunks `require("../index.js")` to reach shared bindings. With
 *    the entry missing from `require.cache`, that re-evaluates the whole main
 *    bundle a second time, which re-registers electron-log and throws
 *    "Attempted to register a second handler for '__ELECTRON_LOG__'".
 *
 * Together they turn any lazy chunk into a landmine. jimp 1.6.1 stepped on it:
 * `@jimp/core` moved to `file-type ^21` and now does `await import("file-type")`
 * inside `Jimp.fromBuffer`, so every image compression threw and every pasted
 * image was silently dropped from Claude Code sessions (#1389).
 *
 * These functions are pure so the decision is testable without a build; the
 * vite plugin in electron.vite.config.ts applies and enforces them.
 */

/**
 * Matches `delete require.cache[__filename]`, tolerating whitespace and the
 * optional trailing semicolon so a reformat or a minifier pass does not slip
 * past the gate.
