/**
 * Guards the team sync lanes against identifiers that claim encryption the
 * client does not perform.
 *
 * Team lanes (trackers, team documents) are PLAINTEXT over TLS under
 * server-managed custody: the server holds the team DEK, encrypts at rest, and
 * can read the payloads. The client holds no team key and does no crypto. The
 * personal lanes (`CollabV3Sync`, `ProjectSyncProvider`) and the local replica
 * on disk are genuinely encrypted -- those files are deliberately NOT in scope
 * here, and renaming them to say "plaintext" would be a real regression.
 *
 * Why this gate exists: the retired client-managed lane left its vocabulary
 * behind. On 2026-08-24 an agent read `EncryptedTrackerItemEnvelope` /
 * `encryptedPayload` / `TrackerEnvelopeCrypto.ts`, concluded the server could
 * not read tracker payloads, and on that basis declared server-side conflict
 * merge architecturally impossible -- ruling out the correct design. The names
 * were not a cosmetic debt; they changed a conclusion.
 *
 * Scope note: this checks IDENTIFIERS, not prose. Comments and string literals
 * are stripped before matching, so "the server encrypts at rest with the team
 * DEK" is fine -- that sentence is true and worth keeping. What is banned is a
 * *name* that asserts client-side crypto.
 *
 * The allowlist below is the point of the gate. Adding a name to it forces you
 * to write down why an encryption-sounding identifier is correct. See
 * docs/IDENTITY_AUTH_AND_ROOMS.md section 6 for the lane table.
